<p class="ph2">THE CURLYTOPS<br />
TOURING AROUND</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />

<small>DOWN THE WELL</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Come</span> on, Jan! Now will be a good time
to try it!”</p>

<p>“All right, Ted. But are you sure it will
be safe?”</p>

<p>“Course I am! Why, it’s a big rope and
I’m not very heavy, Jan.”</p>

<p>“I know that. But s’posing I shouldn’t
be able to pull you up again?”</p>

<p>“Well, I could get up by a ladder, I guess.
Come on now before Trouble comes out to
bother us. He’s in the house with mother
and we have a good chance now.”</p>

<p>Two children, a boy and a girl, each with
clustering curls on their heads, darted down
a path, around the house, and ran toward
the apple orchard at the rear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>Ted Martin’s hair was darker than that
of his sister Janet, but the locks of each were
so clustered on their heads that the children
were more often called “Curlytops,” than
their right name.</p>

<p>Now the curly tops of the brother and sister
were bobbing about as they ran along,
intent on having what they called “fun,”
though, as you will soon see, it developed
into mischief. But that, as Ted said afterward,
wasn’t their fault.</p>

<p>“I’m glad Trouble is in the house,” remarked
Jan, as she hastened along beside
her brother.</p>

<p>“So’m I,” answered Ted. “William is
a good little boy, but when you want to do
something he always wants to do something
else.”</p>

<p>“Always,” agreed Janet, with a wise
shake of her head.</p>

<p>From this you may know that “Trouble”
was only the jolly nickname of the small
brother of Ted and Janet. Mother Martin
used to call him “Dear Trouble” when he
upset a glass of milk on the table or shoved
his plate to the floor. Daddy Martin used
to speak of William as a “Bunch of Trouble”
when he had to drop his paper and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
rush out, perhaps to pull the little fellow’s
head loose from between the fence pickets,
where, possibly, he had thrust it.</p>

<p>Ted and Janet called their little brother
simply “Trouble” and let it go at that.</p>

<p>The two older children had been playing
in the front yard of their home when Ted
had suddenly thought of a trick he had been
wanting to try for a long while. He had a
strange idea in his head, and he needed the
help of Janet to carry it out. Now seemed
a good time.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of the long vacation
from school, and though the Martin family
expected to go away for the summer, plans
had not yet been made.</p>

<p>So Jan and Ted were amusing themselves
as best they could until, tiring of “playing
store,” into Ted’s head had popped his big
idea.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute now, Jan!” cautioned
Ted, as they neared the back of the house
and could look over toward the apple orchard.
It wasn’t a very large orchard, but
there were enough trees to call it by that
name. Though, as yet, the season being
early, only green apples were on the
branches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>“What’s the matter—aren’t you going to
do it?” Jan wanted to know, as her brother
put out a hand and detained her behind a
screening bush.</p>

<p>“Course I’m going to do it!” he declared.
“But I want to look and see if Patrick isn’t
there. Patrick maybe wouldn’t let me do
it.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Janet. “And if Nora
saw us, she maybe wouldn’t let us, either.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Ted, in a low voice. He looked
carefully out from the fringe of the bush,
but saw neither Patrick, who did odd jobs
about the Martin place, nor Nora, the cook;
so the coast was clear.</p>

<p>“Come on, Jan!” Ted whispered.</p>

<p>“Oh, I—I’m almost getting scairt!”
whispered the little girl, as she and her
brother neared the scene of their latest
trick.</p>

<p>“Pooh! Silly! What’s to be scared of?”
asked Ted. “Come on!”</p>

<p>Thus teased, Janet took her brother’s
hand for a quick dash across the open space
to the shelter of the orchard. Suddenly,
when the children were halfway over the
little space, they heard their names called:</p>

<p>“Ted! Jan! Where are you? Come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
here! Mother says you have to ’muse me!
Come on!”</p>

<p>“It’s Trouble!” gasped Janet.</p>

<p>“And we’ve got to amuse him!” sighed
Ted. “Oh, jinkity jinks!”</p>

<p>He kicked the sand at his feet peevishly.</p>

<p>“Come on! Let’s make believe we didn’t
hear him. He hasn’t seen us and we can
hide from him.”</p>

<p>Janet was about to agree to this, but
Trouble was smarter than either of the older
ones gave him credit for. He had run on
after his first call, and now he stood where
he could look full at Ted and Jan.</p>

<p>“I see you!” he laughed. “You playin’
hide-an’-find? Anyhow, mother says you
have to ’muse me! Go on! ’Muse me!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin often, when she was tired of
looking after William or when she had to
do something else, would call to the other
children:</p>

<p>“Come and amuse Trouble!”</p>

<p>Nearly always Jan or Ted would be glad
to do this. But now they had something
else they wanted to do.</p>

<p>“Too late!” sighed Ted. “We can’t skip
away from him now.”</p>

<p>“No, if we did he’d tell mother,” agreed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
Janet. “Oh, I know what we can let him
do! He can do it all alone, too, so we can
go to the diamond mine!” she added.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Ted, to whom the reference
to a “diamond mine,” did not seem
strange. That was part of the game they
were going to play.</p>

<p>“I’ll get the sifter we were using when
we played store, and I’ll let Trouble sift
a lot of sand and tell him to pick out all the
stones,” suggested the little girl. “That
will keep him amused a long while.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess it will,” stated Ted.</p>

<p>“You playin’ hide-an’-find?” asked
Trouble again. This was his name for the
game of hide-and-seek.</p>

<p>“No, we aren’t playing that, Trouble
dear,” said Jan, with more sweetness than
usual in her voice. She wanted to be nice
to her little brother so he would be satisfied
to play by himself.</p>

<p>“You goin’ to ’muse me?” demanded the
little fellow.</p>

<p>“Sure we are!” exclaimed Ted. “I’ll
get the sifter,” he told Janet. “You keep
him here a minute.”</p>

<p>“Come here and I’ll tell you a little
story,” offered Janet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>“I’m comin’,” Trouble announced, as he
toddled to his sister. She kept him amused
until Ted came running back with the sieve
which, a little while before, he and Janet
had borrowed from Nora in the kitchen
so they could use it in sifting sand, which
they pretended was sugar in their play
store.</p>

<p>Near the spot where Trouble had so unexpectedly
found his brother and sister was
some clean sand, and it was this that Janet
had thought William could be induced to
play with, while she and her brother went
on with their own plans.</p>

<p>And, for once at least, Trouble did just
what was wanted of him.</p>

<p>“See the nice sand, Trouble,” murmured
Janet. “Look, you put it in this sifter and
you jiggle it and all the nice little sand falls
through. The big stones and little stones
stay inside. Then you pick out all the
stones and put them in a pile and you sift
more sand. See!”</p>

<p>“Yep, I see,” murmured Trouble. “Let
me shift sand.”</p>

<p>Janet gave him the sieve and filled it for
him. He moved it to and fro and a little
pile of fine sand grew in the shape of a pyramid.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
Trouble looked at the stones left in
the sieve.</p>

<p>“What I do wif these?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Put ’em in a pile and then we’ll make
believe they’re raisins and we’ll stick ’em
in mud pies,” said Ted.</p>

<p>“Oh, I like to make mud pies!” cried
Trouble, with shining eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, but not now! Not now! After a
while!” cried Janet quickly, for the little
fellow seemed ready to drop the sieve.
“What did you want to say that for?” she
asked Ted, in a whisper. “You’ll spoil
everything! Leave it to me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” mumbled Ted. “Go
ahead! As soon as you can leave him alone
come on over to the old well.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Janet. “Now,
Trouble,” she went on, as she filled the sifter
again, “shake this out and pick out all the
stones. Put the big ones in a pile by themselves
and the little ones in a pile by themselves.”</p>

<p>“Den we make mud pies,” laughed
Trouble.</p>

<p>“I guess so—yes—maybe,” murmured
Janet, who did not want to be too sure on
this point. “Now you play here, Trouble,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
and don’t go away, will you?” she asked,
as she prepared to follow Ted.</p>

<p>“Trouble stay here and shift sand,”
gravely promised the little fellow. “But
where you goin’, Jan?” he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Oh, just over here a little way,” she
answered. “I’ll soon be back. Now sift a
lot of sand, Trouble, and pick out all the
stones.”</p>

<p>“Aw right—I shift sand.”</p>

<p>He was having fun now, being “’mused”
as his mother had told him he would be, and
he did not much care what Ted or Janet did—at
least for a while.</p>

<p>“Is he all right?” asked Ted, as his sister
joined him under an apple tree where an old
well had been dug.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess he’ll stay there until we
play diamond mine a while,” said Janet.
“But are you sure it will be all right, Ted?”</p>

<p>“Sure I am. I’ll just step on the bucket
and hold to the rope, and all you’ll have
to do is to keep hold of the handle and let
it unwind slowly. Then I’ll go down in the
well and we’ll play it’s a diamond mine.”</p>

<p>“But how you going to get up again,
Ted?” his sister asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“Why, you can wind up the handle just
as you unwound it, can’t you? It’ll be like
pulling up a bucket of water when there
used to be water in the well. That’s how
I’ll get up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see! All right.”</p>

<p>The Curlytops ran over toward the old
well, which had not been used for a number
of years, the water having seeped out of it,
so that the well was dry. But the curbing,
the windlass, the bucket, and the rope were
still in place, and they had given Ted the
idea for playing diamond mine. He had
seen some pictures of miners going down a
hole in the ground by means of a bucket and
rope, and had got the idea that diamonds
were thus secured.</p>

<p>The reason Ted and Janet had not, before
this, played at the old well, was because they
did not know it existed. It was on some
land next to their house which Mr. Martin
had recently bought. And, learning there
was an old well on it, the children’s father
had decided to do away with it, for it might
be dangerous, even if there was no water
in it, for it was about thirty feet deep.</p>

<p>The first step in doing away with the old
well had been to have Patrick clear away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
the weeds around it. Then the curbing was
to have been taken away and the well filled
up. But when Patrick had cut down the
weeds he was called to other tasks, and so
the old well stood plainly revealed.</p>

<p>Ted and Janet had discovered it, and
then into Ted’s mind had come the idea of
going down into the dry well. He had tested
the rope, with its bucket and windlass, and
found that it worked.</p>

<p>“Now, Jan,” said her brother, when they
were at the well, with no one near to stop
their mischievous play, “I’ll climb up and
stand on the bucket. You keep hold of the
handle and let it unwind slowly. I don’t
want to go down too fast, you know.”</p>

<p>“No, I guess you don’t,” agreed Jan.</p>

<p>“After I get down to the bottom I’ll make
believe dig diamonds,” went on Ted. “Then
you can twist the handle the other way and
pull me up. After that I’ll let you go
down.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to go down!” said Jan
quickly, after one look into the black depths
of the well. “You can go. I don’t want
to.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Ted cheerfully. “I’ll
go down twice. Now get ready.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>He climbed the well curbing and put one
foot on the edge of the bucket, which was
a little way below the top of the curbing, or
elevated wooden rim about the well. The
rope was wound around a wooden roller, or
windlass, to the end of which a crank was
made fast. And there was a ratchet catch
to prevent the rope from unwinding and
letting the bucket down into the well until
such time as the person drawing was ready.
This catch now prevented Ted from dropping
down into the well.</p>

<p>The curly-haired little boy steadied himself
on the edge of the bucket by holding
to the rope above his head. He looked down
into the well. It was deep and black, but
there was no water in it, so Ted did not
hesitate.</p>

<p>“All right, Jan! Let me down!” he called
to his sister.</p>

<p>Already he was a little way down the
shaft of the well, for the rope was partly
unwound and the bucket perhaps two feet
below the top of the curbing when Ted took
his place.</p>

<p>Janet loosened the catch of the windlass
and then, holding to the handle with all her
strength, let it slowly revolve. It would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
have gotten out of control, and would have
whirled around very fast, for Ted was much
heavier than a bucket of water, only the affair
was old, rusted and stiff. So, after
all, Ted was quite safely lowered.</p>

<p>Down and down he went into the black
depths of the old, dry well.</p>

<p>“It’s lots of fun, Jan!” he called up.
“You’d better come down next time!”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to. You can,” answered
his sister.</p>

<p>“Now I’m all the way down. I’m standing
on the bottom!” called up Ted. “I’m
going to dig for diamonds!”</p>

<p>Jan could see that there was no longer
a strain on the rope. The handle turned
freely. Suddenly it gave a little quiver, Jan
saw the rope slip loose from around the
windlass and then, as the end of it fell down
the well, the little girl screamed:</p>

<p>“Oh, Ted! Ted! Oh, something dreadful
happened!”</p>

<small>GOOD NEWS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Down</span> in the dark depths of the old well,
Ted Martin heard what his sister called in
such frightened tones.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he asked.</p>

<p>A moment later he learned on his own account.
For the bucket rope having slipped
off the windlass, from which it had rotted
away, tumbled down the well. It caught for
a moment on a projecting stone, and then
went down into the depths. It fell partly
on top of Ted’s head as he stepped off the
edge of the bucket on to the pile of dried
sticks and leaves which had blown and
tumbled into the well during the years it had
not been in use.</p>

<p>“Oh, Teddy!” cried Janet. “The rope
came loose and it fell down!”</p>

<p>“I know it did,” Ted answered. For the
rope was coiled about him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“Then how are you going to get up?”
Janet wanted to know. “How are you going
to get up out of the well when I can’t
wind up the rope?”</p>

<p>To this Ted made answer:</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Jan. I guess I’m in a
sort of pickle. But wait a minute. Don’t
run away and leave me!”</p>

<p>Janet had no such idea. She wouldn’t
desert Ted in trouble.</p>

<p>While the little fellow is down in the old,
dry well, trying to think of a way to get out,
and while Janet is also puzzling her head
over the same matter, I will take just a moment
to let my new readers know something
about the Curlytops.</p>

<p>I have told you the reason for their nickname.
They had been christened in this order:
Theodore Baradale Martin, who was
called Ted or Teddy, except when he had
done something wrong, and then he heard
his full name spoken. Next came Janet
Louise Martin, which was shortened into
Janet or Jan. She was just a year younger
than Ted. Last of all was William Anthony
Martin. He was “Trouble,” you know.</p>

<p>Mr. Richard Martin, the father of Trouble
and the Curlytops, was the owner of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
large, general store in Cresco, in one of our
eastern states. In the first book of this
series, called “The Curlytops at Cherry
Farm,” I related how the children went to
visit Grandpa Martin on his wonderful
farm, and I told you what happened after
they reached there. During other vacation
seasons the children traveled to Star Island,
they were snowed in, visited Uncle Frank’s
ranch, and camped on Silver Lake with
Uncle Ben. The children had some queer
pets, as you may learn by reading another
book, and they had many playmates with
whom they had jolly times. After a trip to
the woods, the children found something
in the sand, as told in the book just before
this, called “The Curlytops at Sunset
Beach.”</p>

<p>After the summer at the shore the Martin
family returned to Cresco. Through the
long winter Janet and Ted played in the
snow. Then came spring. Now it was summer
again and the long vacation had arrived.</p>

<p>“And it means a lot of work, too,” sighed
Mrs. Martin, on the last day of school. “I’m
sure I don’t know what the children will do
with so much time on their hands!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>But this did not worry Ted, Janet or
Trouble. They knew they could have fun,
and one of the ways hit on by Ted and his
sister was to play “diamond mine,” as we
find them doing at the old well when this
story opens.</p>

<p>“Do you think you can get out, Ted?” his
sister called anxiously down into the depths
of the dark well.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” was Ted’s answer. “But
don’t go away. I’m going to try to climb
up, Jan.”</p>

<p>“How you going to climb up?” the little
girl wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s a lot of stones sticking out
on the sides. They’re like steps, and maybe
I can get up on them.”</p>

<p>Ted tried; but though a man or an older
boy might have managed to hoist himself
out of the well in this way, it was beyond
the strength of the Curlytop lad. He got
up a little way but slipped back to the soft
bed of dried leaves at the bottom of the well.</p>

<p>“Did you hurt yourself?” asked Jan anxiously,
as she heard her brother grunt as he
slipped back.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t hurt myself,” he answered.
“But I jiggled myself a little.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>Ted’s use of the word “jiggled” reminded
Jan that she had left Trouble “jiggling”
the sieve at the pile of sand. She wondered
if her little brother was all right, but she
did not want to leave Ted in order to make
sure.</p>

<p>However, she did not need to do this for
just as Ted called up to her that he was
going to try to toss up the rope, so she
could fasten it to the windlass, Janet saw
her little brother coming along a path that
she and Ted had trampled through the
weeds.</p>

<p>“Oh, now I is found you!” remarked
Trouble, with a smile on his cute, dirty little
face. “I is found you! Here is Jan,
Mother!” he called more loudly. “I is
found her!”</p>

<p>“Is mother looking for us?” asked Janet.</p>

<p>“Yes, Jan,” answered the voice of Mrs.
Martin herself. “I told you and Teddy to
amuse William, and I find him all alone
sifting sand. Not but what he was having
fun, but I thought you would stay with him.
I asked him where you went and he pointed
off this way. Why, what are you doing at
the old well?” went on the mother who, having
followed Trouble along the weed-grown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
path, now saw Janet standing near the curbing
and windlass. “What are you doing
there?” she repeated.</p>

<p>“Teddy—now—Teddy—he’s down
there!” gasped Jan, pointing.</p>

<p>“Teddy in the well!” exclaimed Mrs.
Martin. “Is he——”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any water in it,” Janet hastened
to add, and then Mrs. Martin herself
remembered that her husband had told
her that same fact. So she asked more
calmly:</p>

<p>“How did Teddy get down in the well?”
She hurried forward, keeping a tight hold
of Trouble’s hand, so he wouldn’t slip into
the black depths.</p>

<p>“We were playing diamond mine,” Janet
began to explain, when Ted, at the bottom of
the well, heard his mother’s voice and cried:</p>

<p>“I’m all right! I can get up if you can
fasten the rope to the windlass, or lower a
ladder to me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Teddy! Why did you ever go down
there?” cried Mrs. Martin, as she leaned
over the curbing and looked down. “You
shouldn’t have done such a thing!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to get stuck down here,
Mother!” the boy answered. He could look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
up and see his mother quite plainly, for she
was in the sunlight. But she could hardly
see him at the bottom of the well.</p>

<p>“The rope slipped off,” explained Janet.</p>

<p>“If we had a cowboy here he could lasso
Teddy up,” said Trouble, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Yes, but we haven’t any cowboy,” said
Mrs. Martin. “Jan, you run and tell Patrick
to come here. Tell him to bring a ladder.
I hope we have one long enough.
Hurry, Jan!”</p>

<p>Now that her mother was on the scene,
Janet felt sure that Teddy would soon be
out of the well. As she hastened back
toward the house, she saw Patrick working
in the garden.</p>

<p>“Please take a long ladder to the old well
so Teddy can get out, Patrick,” she begged.
“Hurry!”</p>

<p>“What’s that, Jan?” asked the man of
all work.</p>

<p>When the little girl had explained, Patrick
ran off toward the barn, chuckling to
himself and saying:</p>

<p>“They call the little one ‘Trouble,’ but
I’m not sure but what it would be a good
name for the other two. Sure, they’re into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
twice as much mischief as William! It’s a
good thing the well is dry!”</p>

<p>Patrick was on his way to the well, carrying
a long ladder, which, he told Janet,
would surely reach the bottom, and the little
girl was following him when she saw her
father coming around the house by a side
path.</p>

<p>It was not usual for Mr. Martin to come
home from his store in the middle of the
afternoon. When he did, something extraordinary
nearly always happened, and
this time Janet thought he had heard about
Teddy. So she said:</p>

<p>“He’s all right now, Daddy! We’ll soon
have him out!”</p>

<p>“Who’s all right? Who’s going to be
out soon?” asked Mr. Martin, much puzzled.
“And what are you going to do with
that ladder, Patrick?”</p>

<p>“Sure an’ I’m going to get Teddy out of
the old well.”</p>

<p>“Out of the old well?” cried Mr. Martin.
“Do you mean to tell me Ted has fallen
down there?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t perzackly <i>fall</i> in,” said Janet.
“I let him down by the rope, but the rope
slipped off and he’s down there. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
couldn’t climb out, so mother told Patrick
to bring the ladder.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if your mother’s there I guess
matters will soon be all right,” said Mr.
Martin, breathing more easily. “Why did
you children go to that well? We must fill
it up at once, Patrick.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I was going to do it this afternoon.
But they got ahead of me, the Curlytops
did.”</p>

<p>Mr. Martin hurried on with Patrick, helping
him carry the ladder, while Janet followed.
Mrs. Martin and Trouble were still
standing at the well curbing, and when Mrs.
Martin saw her husband she, too, thought he
had come home because of what had happened
to Ted.</p>

<p>Then, as she knew he could not have heard
of it at the store, she said to Mr. Martin:</p>

<p>“Is anything wrong? Why did you come
home at this time of day?”</p>

<p>“Everything is all right,” replied Mr.
Martin, with a smile. “I came home to tell
you some good news. But first we must get
Teddy out of the well.”</p>

<p>Mr. Martin leaned over and looked down
into the depths. Ted saw his father and
called to him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>“I’m all right!”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of it,” was the answer. “We’re
going to lower the ladder down to you so
you can climb up. Stand to one side so it
won’t hit you.”</p>

<p>And as her father and Patrick lowered
the ladder into the well, Janet wondered
what good news it was that had brought Mr.
Martin home in the middle of the afternoon.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE CARDWELL ALBUMS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted Martin</span> was in no danger in the dry
well. His father and mother knew this as
soon as they had looked down at him. There
was not a drop of water in the well, and the
sides were well walled up so they wouldn’t
cave in.</p>

<p>“Don’t ever do anything like this again,
Theodore!” his father said quite sternly to
the little chap, as the ladder was being put
into place.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Teddy.</p>

<p>“We didn’t mean to do it,” said Janet.</p>

<p>“I know you didn’t,” her mother admitted.
“But just think what would have
happened if there had been water in the
well?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have gone down if there had
been water in,” Teddy called up, for he
could hear what was being said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>“Well, I’m glad you have that much
sense,” his father told him. “Now, Patrick,
you hold the upper end of the ladder
steady and I’ll put this end down in.”</p>

<p>Slowly the ladder was lowered into the
well, Teddy crowding back against the
stones as he stood on the leafy bottom, so
as to be out of the way. At last the ladder
was in place.</p>

<p>“Now can you climb up, Ted?” called his
father.</p>

<p>“Sure I can climb up,” was the answer,
and a little later the head of the Curlytop
lad appeared above the curbing. There were
leaves and dirt and cobwebs in Teddy’s hair,
but he didn’t mind that. “I brought the
end of the rope up with me,” he said, showing
it to his father. “You can fasten it to
the windlass if you want to.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to,” declared Mr. Martin.
“And, just so you and Janet won’t be
tempted to play diamond mine again, we’ll
drop this old rope back to the bottom of the
well. And you must start at once, Patrick,
to fill it up.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I will,” was the answer.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin took the end of the rope from
Ted and let it drop back into the black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
depths where it fell on the bucket, already
on the bottom.</p>

<p>Then the ladder was pulled up, and as
Mr. Martin walked back toward the house
with his wife and children Patrick got a
shovel and began tossing dirt and rocks into
the well, to fill it up level.</p>

<p>“There’ll be no more Curlytops down in
you!” said the man, as he labored away.
The wooden curbing was torn loose and the
windlass broken. It was the end of the old
well.</p>

<p>“But, anyhow, I got down it all right,”
declared Ted, as he looked back and saw
Patrick filling up the hole.</p>

<p>“Yes, but you might not have gotten out
so easily if we hadn’t come to help you,”
suggested Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s right,” agreed Ted. “I
tried to climb out, but it was hard work.”</p>

<p>“He was like ‘ding-dong bell, pussy in the
well,’ wasn’t he, Mother?” laughed Trouble,
as he stumbled along beside his father.</p>

<p>“Yes, and daddy was Big Johnnie Stout
who got Teddy out!” added Janet. “But
what’s the good news?” she asked. “You
said you had good news, Daddy.”</p>

<p>“It’s about our summer vacation,” replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
Mr. Martin. “You know, my dear,”
he went on, turning to his wife, “we haven’t
been able to make any plans for the vacation,
because I didn’t know how matters
were going at the store. Well, I have just
found out that I can get away next week,
and be gone for a month, so I hurried home
to let you know. We shall have a fine vacation
this season!”</p>

<p>“Where are we going?” asked Ted,
brushing some of the well dirt from his
clothes.</p>

<p>“To the seashore?” asked Janet.</p>

<p>“No, we aren’t going any special place,”
her father replied.</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought you said we were going
to have a fine vacation!” objected Ted.</p>

<p>“So I did, and so we are. But we aren’t
going to any special place. What do you
say to touring around—going from place to
place in our auto, and perhaps taking a trip
in a motor boat? How would my Curlytops
like that?” and Mr. Martin ruffled first the
hair of Janet and then that of Teddy.</p>

<p>“I think that will be lots of fun!” cried
Janet.</p>

<p>“Do you mean touring around in our car<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
and sleeping in it and camping out and all
that?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“Well, something like that,” agreed Mr.
Martin. “Of course we can’t exactly sleep
in our auto, as it isn’t a Gypsy wagon. But
we can take along a tent that can be fastened
to the auto, and we can sleep in that if we
wish. Or we can put up at hotels along
the way. It will be partly a camping trip.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’ll be dandy fun!” cried Ted.
“When can we start?”</p>

<p>“Next week. But in the meanwhile don’t
go climbing into any more wells,” urged his
father.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I won’t!” the Curlytop boy
promised. “Oh, hurray for touring around!
Hurray for touring around!” he cried,
turning a somersault on the grass.</p>

<p>“’Ray! ’Ray!” echoed Trouble, trying
to do as he saw his brother do. But Trouble
toppled over to one side, laughing as he fell.</p>

<p>“We’ll have lovely fun!” confided Janet
to her mother. “I think daddy is just wonderful,
don’t you, Mother?”</p>

<p>“He is, indeed, quite wonderful,” agreed
Mrs. Martin, with a smile.</p>

<p>From then on, as you can imagine, there
were busy times in the home of the Curlytops.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
Once it was decided that they would
spend part of the summer vacation touring
around, going to no particular place, but
stopping wherever they felt like it, many
preparations had to be made.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin owned a big touring car, and
he bought a camping outfit and tent to go
with it. The tent could be fastened to one
side of the car, and cots put beneath the
canvas covering.</p>

<p>“The children can sleep in the car, when
it rains too hard,” decided Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“And can we cook, and eat and everything
like that out of doors?” Janet wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“Of course we have to cook!” declared
Ted. “I’m going to make the campfires,”
he declared.</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that,” Mr. Martin said.
“Very likely we’ll take along an alcohol
stove. That’s more certain for cooking than
wet wood. But we can have a campfire once
in a while.”</p>

<p>Ted and Janet told their many boy and
girl chums about the coming touring trip,
and all the lads and lassies wished they were
as lucky as were the Curlytops.</p>

<p>It was one evening, about four days after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
Ted had gone down into the well which was
now filled up, that, as the Curlytops and
the others of the family were talking about
the coming trip, a ring sounded at the front
door.</p>

<p>“I wonder who that can be?” said Mrs.
Martin.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s pretty hard to guess,” her husband
answered, with a laugh. “But we’ll
soon see, for Nora is opening the door.”</p>

<p>In came Mr. James Cardwell, an elderly
neighbor who lived two or three houses down
the street. Under his arm Mr. Cardwell carried
two large books, which, a second look
told Janet and Ted, were old-fashioned photograph
albums.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Mr. Cardwell,” said Mr.
Martin. “Have a chair.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, but I didn’t come to stay long,”
said Mr. Cardwell, as he put his albums
down on the table. “I came to ask you to
do me a favor.”</p>

<p>“Did you want our pictures to put in your
album, Mr. Cardwell?” asked Ted, for he
and Janet had had their photographs taken
the week before.</p>

<p>“Thank you, little man, but these albums
are filled,” was the answer. “I’d like to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
get your pictures, though, for another album
I have at home. What I came over for,”
he went on, “is to see if you would take these
albums to my brother Reuben in Bentville,
Mr. Martin. I hear you are going on a long
auto tour, and that you will pass through
Bentville. Is that right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we planned to make Bentville one
of our stops,” said Mr. Martin, naming a
town about three hundred miles away.</p>

<p>“That’s my old home,” said Mr. Cardwell.
“There is going to be a reunion of
the Cardwell families there in the fall. We
have it every year. All the Cardwells for
miles around come to this reunion.</p>

<p>“Now in this album are a lot of pictures
of Cardwells that are dead and gone—dead
and gone,” and the old man’s voice trembled.
“Some of their relatives would like
to look at these pictures. I thought it would
be a good plan to have them at the reunion.”</p>

<p>“Very nice, I should say,” remarked Mrs.
Martin.</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought. Well, I want
to send my albums on ahead, before I start,
which won’t be until fall. I want to send
them to my brother, Reuben Cardwell of
Bentville. The albums have been in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
family many years. I’d hate to see them
lost, or have anything happen to them. I’m
afraid to send them by mail or express. But
I thought, as long as you’re going to tour
out that way, you wouldn’t mind, Mr. Martin,
leaving these albums with my brother.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to do that,” replied the
Curlytops’ father. “If you think you can
trust me with them,” he added.</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll trust you,” said Mr. Cardwell.
“Though we think so much of these
albums in our family that I wouldn’t trust
every one. I don’t know what would happen
if they got lost or were destroyed. See,
here are pictures of my dear little twin girls,
who died when they were ten years old.
They’re the only pictures we have of them—Mary
and Alice.”</p>

<p>He turned the heavy pages and showed
pictures of two pretty girls, with long, curling
hair. The pictures were of a bygone
time, old-fashioned and rather strange to
the Curlytops. But they could see that Mr.
Cardwell thought a great deal of them and
of the albums.</p>

<p>“And here is another picture we prize
highly,” said the elderly neighbor. “It’s a
picture of my brother’s boy Tom. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
only eighteen,” and he turned to the photograph
of a fine-looking lad.</p>

<p>“Did he die, too?” asked Mrs. Martin
softly.</p>

<p>“Yes—at least, we suppose so,” said Mr.
Cardwell gently. “He went away to be a
sailor. His ship was sunk and we never
heard anything more from him. I suppose
the poor young fellow died at sea. This is
the only picture of him, and I know how
badly my brother would feel if it were lost.
So will you take charge of these old family
albums, Mr. Martin, and deliver them in
Bentville?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll be very careful of them,” promised
Mr. Martin. “I know what it means
to lose such things.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t they ever find the boy who was
lost at sea?” asked Ted, to whom this little
story appealed greatly.</p>

<p>“No, Ted, we never heard a word from
him,” sighed Mr. Cardwell. “I suppose the
sea has him. He is as much lost as my dear
little twin girls are,” and he turned back to
the pictures of the children.</p>

<p>“I have a small chest, or box, down at the
store, Mr. Cardwell,” said Mr. Martin, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
the caller was about to leave. “I’ll put your
albums in that chest so they will be safe.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. Tell my brother, when you
see him, why I sent them to him this way—I
didn’t like to trust the mails or the express,
and I won’t be out to Bentville myself
until fall.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell him,” was the promise.</p>

<p>Ted and Janet were looking at the queer,
heavy covers of the old books and wondering
what games the pictured children used to
play when they were on earth, when suddenly
from outside came a number of
sounds.</p>

<p>There was the sound of the clanging of
bells, the blowing of whistles and the shouting
of men and boys.</p>

<p>“It’s a fire! A fire down the street!”
cried Ted, as he raced to the door. “Oh,
Mr. Cardwell, I guess your house is on fire!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>A BIG CROWD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> causes quite so much excitement
as does a fire. And when the fire is on your
own street, and near your house, and perhaps
in the home of some one you know—why,
then there is excitement enough to
cause even the grown-ups to move about
quickly.</p>

<p>And this is just what happened when Ted
Martin called out:</p>

<p>“I guess your house is on fire, Mr. Cardwell!”</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Martin, as well as their visitor
who had brought the two old photograph
albums with him, ran to the door. And you
may be sure that Janet was there ahead of
them, for she had heard what her brother
shouted. William, also, was right there,
making his way in and out among chairs
until he finally pushed through between
Ted’s legs as that lad stood on the porch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“I’m goin’ to fire!” cried the little fellow.</p>

<p>“No, Trouble! You stay here!” commanded
Ted, catching hold of him just in
time.</p>

<p>“It is a fire, surely enough,” declared
Mrs. Martin, when she had looked down the
street.</p>

<p>“And it’s near my house, if it isn’t in it!”
exclaimed Mr. Cardwell. “Excuse me!” he
said hastily, as he pushed his way between
Ted and Janet on the steps. “But I’d better
get down there!”</p>

<p>“I’ll come and help,” offered Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>“May I come?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“No, Son, you stay with your mother,”
directed his father.</p>

<p>As the two men hurried out of the front
gate, joining the throng that was running
toward the scene of the fire, Mrs. Martin
took Trouble by one hand and Janet by the
other and said:</p>

<p>“We’ll just walk down a little way to see
what’s going on. Come along, Ted.”</p>

<p>Much pleased that he did not have to stay
away altogether from the fire, the Curlytop
lad followed his mother and the others.
The engines were already on hand, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
was their puffing and tooting of whistles
that had made some of the noise.</p>

<p>“It isn’t Mr. Cardwell’s house, though,”
said Mrs. Martin, when she and the Curlytops,
with Trouble, had gone far enough
down the street to see just where the fire
was. “It’s next door to him.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t want a fire next door to me,”
sighed Janet.</p>

<p>“I would!” cried Ted. “You could see it
fine!”</p>

<p>“A fire is a terrible thing,” said Mrs.
Martin. “We shouldn’t want one anywhere
near us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, of course not! I don’t exactly
<i>want</i> one,” admitted Ted. “But if one has
<i>got</i> to come I wish it would be near our
house, but not in it, so I could see it good.”</p>

<p>“This isn’t a very big fire,” observed
Janet, when they had watched for a few
minutes. “I guess it’s out now.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” said her mother.</p>

<p>And such proved to be the case, for in a
little while the firemen who had rushed into
the home of Mr. Blakeson, next door to the
residence of Mr. Cardwell, came out with a
long, thin hose. It was the hose from the
chemical engine, and not the big water hose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“It was only a fire in the chimney,” said
Mr. Martin, as he came walking back with
Mr. Cardwell. “No damage done, but the
folks were pretty well frightened. They
put it out with chemicals.”</p>

<p>“How could a chimney be on fire?” Jan
wanted to know. “A chimney is brick, and
bricks can’t burn.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t the bricks that burn,” her father
explained. “But when a chimney has been
used a number of years it gets coated, or
lined on the bricks inside, with soot. Soot
contains oils and other things that burn.
Finally, some day, a hot fire sets the soot
inside the chimney on fire, and it burns
fiercely. And if it burned long enough it
would make the bricks so hot that they
would set fire to the roof or the wooden
parts of the house near them. That’s why
a chimney fire is dangerous, even though the
bricks themselves can’t burn.”</p>

<p>“Did they put salt on the fire?” asked
Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho!” laughed Ted. “I’ve heard of
putting salt on the tail of a wild bird to
tame it, but I didn’t know you put salt on
a fire.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you do, sometimes,” stated Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Martin. “Salt is said to put out chimney
fires. Some sort of chemical is released
when salt is heated, and this smothers the
fire in the chimney. But the firemen put this
fire out, and without any damage being
done.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that,” said Mrs. Martin, as
they went back to the house.</p>

<p>“And I’m glad the fire wasn’t in my
house,” remarked Mr. Cardwell. “If it had
been, and if those albums had burned, with
those pictures of my children and my
brother’s boy—pictures we never could get
again—my wife and I would have felt very
sad. My wife thinks a great deal of those
albums. I’ve been planning for a long time
to send them out to my brother, but we never
dared trust them to any one before. I hope
you will take good care of them, Mr.
Martin.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I surely will, Mr. Cardwell,” replied
the father of the Curlytops.</p>

<p>That night, when the children were in
bed and Mr. and Mrs. Martin were quietly
talking over their plans for the coming tour
around the country, Mrs. Martin said:</p>

<p>“I almost wish you didn’t have to bother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
with those two big albums of pictures,
Dick!”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked her husband.</p>

<p>“Oh, just suppose something happens to
them?”</p>

<p>“Nothing will happen to them. I’ll pack
them in that small chest I have down at the
store, and we’ll put it in the back of the auto.
When we reach Bentville I’ll give the albums
to Mr. Cardwell’s brother. That will
end the matter.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad when it is ended,” said
Mrs. Martin, as she carefully carried the
precious old books of pictures upstairs with
her.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with them,
my dear?” asked her husband, as he noticed
what she was doing.</p>

<p>“I thought I’d have them handy so I
could pick them up and run out with them
in case our house caught fire during the
night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense!” laughed Mr. Martin.
“Nothing is going to happen!”</p>

<p>But it did. Not that night, nor the next
night, but before very long, as you shall
read.</p>

<p>Ted and Janet, with Trouble also, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
very busy the next day, going over their toys
and playthings to pick out the things they
wanted to take on the tour with them. Jan
had a number of dolls, a ball, some books,
a few things she thought her dolls might
need and even a carriage. Ted had picked
out some books, his top, a pair of roller
skates and a bow and arrows.</p>

<p>“Why, children, you can’t take all those
things!” laughed their mother. “There
wouldn’t be room in the auto, for one thing,
and, besides, you will have no time to play
with your toys. We shall be traveling most
of the day, and at night you’ll want to sleep.
Don’t take any of those things.”</p>

<p>After some talk Ted and Janet agreed to
limit the toys they would take with them.
Janet picked out the doll she liked best and
one book, and Ted took a ball and a book.
As for Trouble——</p>

<p>Well, by the time Mrs. Martin had settled
on what the two older children could take,
she had forgotten about Trouble. Then, all
of a sudden, she remembered him.</p>

<p>“Where is William?” she asked.</p>

<p>Ted and Janet looked at each other. They,
too, had forgotten their small brother. But
a moment later a cry was heard:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>“Come and get me out! Come and get
me out!”</p>

<p>“There’s Trouble now!” exclaimed Janet.</p>

<p>“Oh, what has happened to William
now?” sighed Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>By this time Janet had run into the front
yard, and from there she shouted:</p>

<p>“Here’s Trouble! He’s all right! But
he’s got his head stuck in the fence and he
can’t get loose!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin and Ted rushed out to find
that the little boy had stuck his head in
between two pickets of the fence, at a place
where one picket was loose. His head had
gone in easily enough, but when he tried to
draw back his ears stuck out so he couldn’t.</p>

<p>“Oh, my poor little William!” said his
mother.</p>

<p>“I’ll get him loose!” exclaimed Ted,
which he did, by pulling off the loose picket
so there was room enough for his little
brother to draw back his head.</p>

<p>Trouble was frightened, and the skin,
back of his ears, was scratched a little, but
otherwise he was not hurt.</p>

<p>“What made you stick your head through
the fence like that, William?” his mother
asked him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“I—now—I was pickin’ a flower to take
in the auto with us,” Trouble explained. “I
reached through the fence to get the posie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the little darling!” murmured Jan,
kissing him. “I’ll pick flowers for you,”
she offered. “Don’t stick your head through
the fence again.”</p>

<p>She went out and found where her little
brother had reached out to gather some
flowers that grew just beyond the fence. He
could have gone out of the gate to get them,
but, instead, he reached through the pickets.
Jan picked some blossoms and took them to
Trouble.</p>

<p>Such happenings as this did not worry
Mrs. Martin much, for so many of them
took place each day that she was getting
used to them. Trouble soon stopped his crying
and went out to play with Ted and
Janet, while their mother went on with the
preparations for the auto tour.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin, that day, brought home the
small, stout box to hold the Cardwell albums,
and they were put in and locked up,
ready to be taken to Mr. Reuben Cardwell
of Bentville.</p>

<p>In a few days all was in readiness for the
start. Mr. Martin left his store in charge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
of his head clerk, the house was closed up,
the auto had been piled with valises, and
the tent, for sleeping at night, had been
strapped on the running-board. In piled
the Curlytops and Trouble and Mr. Martin
blew the horn.</p>

<p>“Good-by! Good-by!” called friends,
neighbors and the playmates of the children.</p>

<p>“Good-by! Good-by!” echoed the Curlytops.</p>

<p>Just then along came running Jack Turton,
a funny little fat chap. He was all out
of breath.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Jack? Is there a
fire?” asked Mr. Martin, as he was about to
start the auto.</p>

<p>“No, sir. But there’s a terrible big crowd
down in the meadow near the white bridge!”
gasped Jack. “Oh, it’s a terrible big crowd,
and I’m going down to see. Maybe there’s
somebody drowned!”</p>

<p>Away he rushed, as fast as his fat legs
would take him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />

<small>MOVING PICTURES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Well</span> did the Curlytops know the place
spoken of in such a hurry by fat Jack Turton.
Ted and Janet had often gathered
flowers in the meadow, and Ted had, more
than once, caught fish under that same white
bridge spoken of by the fat lad.</p>

<p>“The water is deep down by the white
bridge,” said Ted, as he watched Jack hurrying
down the street. Other children,
gathered to say good-by to the Curlytops,
had heard what Jack said about a big crowd
in the meadow, and they were following him
down to the place.</p>

<p>“I hope no one is drowned,” murmured
Mrs. Martin, looking at her three children
in the auto and feeling thankful that they
were safe with her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Daddy!” exclaimed Janet, “couldn’t
we drive down past the meadow on our way
and see what the crowd is there for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>“Maybe it’s a circus!” exclaimed Trouble,
who had caught some of the talk, but
didn’t know exactly what it was all about.</p>

<p>“No, it can’t be a circus,” declared Ted.
“There haven’t been any circus posters
around town. I’d have seen ’em if there
was.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a circus,” decided Mr. Martin.
“I think, as long as we have time, that I’ll
drive around that way. We can take the
road over the white bridge as well as any
other.”</p>

<p>In fact, the Curlytops were going to tour
around the country, not going to any certain
place at any certain time, so they could do
as they pleased, which is half the fun of
touring.</p>

<p>“Dick,” said Mrs. Martin, touching her
husband gently on the arm as he was about
to start the car down the street after Jack
and the other children, “perhaps we had
better not go down there.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” he asked.</p>

<p>“If it’s a drowning it would be a sad
sight, and——”</p>

<p>Mr. Martin appeared undecided as his
wife brought this thought to his mind, and
it might have been that he would have taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
some other route, except that he saw Doctor
Whitney driving along in his small car. The
physician was coming from the direction of
the white bridge.</p>

<p>“Dr. Whitney will know if an accident
has happened,” said Mr. Martin. “If
there’s been a drowning he wouldn’t be coming
away from it. He would stay there
and try to save the drowned person.”</p>

<p>“Please ask him,” suggested Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>Accordingly her husband called:</p>

<p>“Anything the matter down at the white
bridge, Doctor?”</p>

<p>The doctor brought his car to a halt near
that of the Curlytops, and waved his hand
to the children after he had raised his hat
to Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“Drowning at the white bridge?” he
asked. “No, nothing like that. Though
there may be if they keep on. There’s a
big crowd there and some of the youngsters
may fall in.”</p>

<p>“What’s going on?” asked Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“Is it a circus?” Trouble asked. “I’d
like to see a nellifunt!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you saw one once!” laughed his
mother.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t a circus, though the kids are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
having almost as much fun as if there was
one,” chuckled the doctor. “And the men
are having as much trouble trying to keep
the boys and girls back as though there were
two circuses.”</p>

<p>“Sounds rather interesting!” laughed
Mr. Martin. “But I’m glad no one is
drowned—that’s what fat little Jack suggested.”</p>

<p>“What in the world is it?” asked Mrs.
Martin, and Ted and Janet listened eagerly
to the answer of the physician, for they
could not imagine what was happening at
the white bridge.</p>

<p>“It’s moving pictures,” the doctor replied.</p>

<p>“Moving pictures!” cried the Curlytops
together, just as twins might have done.
But Ted and Janet were not twins, though
they were born on the same day of the year.
Ted was exactly a year ahead of his sister.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know they were showing movies
in the meadow,” said Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>“They aren’t <i>showing</i> moving pictures,”
replied Doctor Whitney. “They’re <i>taking</i>
them.”</p>

<p>“Taking movies!” gasped Ted. “Oh, I
want to see that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“Real moving pictures?” Janet wanted
to know.</p>

<p>“I guess they’re real enough,” answered
the doctor. “I don’t know much about such
things, but there is a company of men and
women down in the meadow, posing around
on the bridge and on boats in the river.
They’re all painted up—I mean their faces—and
they are wearing fancy clothes. A
lot of men with megaphones are shouting directions,
and other men are grinding away
at the cranks of moving picture machines.
So I guess it’s real enough.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Daddy, please take us there!”
begged the Curlytops.</p>

<p>“Shall we go, Mother?” asked Mr. Martin
of his wife.</p>

<p>“Yes, I would like to see it,” she answered.
“And I’m sure the children would
be amused.”</p>

<p>“Oh, say, I guess we would!” murmured
Janet.</p>

<p>“Come on, Dad! Step on it!” cried Ted,
meaning for his father to press on the gasoline
accelerator of the car and move the
machine faster.</p>

<p>“Ted and Janet, they didn’t ’muse me,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
remarked Trouble. “An’ Ted, he fell down
in the well—he did!”</p>

<p>He remembered this event quite clearly.</p>

<p>“Well, we hope no one falls into the
river,” laughed Mrs. Martin, as they said
good-day to Doctor Whitney and moved
along. A large creek, or a small river,
whichever way you looked at it, flowed under
the white bridge on the outskirts of
Cresco.</p>

<p>“Let’s go! Let’s go!” chanted Ted.</p>

<p>“I’d love to watch them take movies,” remarked
Janet. “I’ve never seen them do
it.”</p>

<p>“I did once, at a baseball game,” stated
Ted. “But it didn’t amount to much.
This’ll be a lot better.”</p>

<p>As the Curlytops approached the white
bridge and the meadow through which
flowed the river, they saw others also hurrying
to the scene. For Cresco was a small
city, or a large town, you might say, and
anything like excitement—such as taking
moving pictures near it—was sure to draw
a throng.</p>

<p>As Mr. Martin drove his car over the
bridge and down a lane into the meadow,
where many other cars were parked, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
was no doubt about what was going on.
Moving pictures were certainly being taken
there, or “filmed,” to use the right word.</p>

<p>“Oh, look at the cowboys!” cried Ted,
for some of the actors were attired in western
suits—big hats, “chaps,” or leather
breeches, and spurs on their shoes, while
some of them carried coils of ropes.
“They’re lassoes,” explained Ted.</p>

<p>“Pooh, I knew that!” scoffed Jan.</p>

<p>“Why, there’s quite a company of them!”
remarked Mrs. Martin, as she noticed the
number of men and women who, it was plain
to be seen, were not residents of Cresco.
They belonged to the company. “Why do
you suppose they came here to take pictures?”
she asked her husband.</p>

<p>“It’s hard to say,” he answered. “Probably
the play they are taking needed just
such a scene in it as this bridge, river and
meadow provide. The company is out on
‘location,’ as it is called. That is, they have
come out from their studio, or the ‘lot,’ as
they call it, and they have found just the
right location for making certain scenes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, look, that lady is going to jump
from the boat!” cried Janet, pointing to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
small skiff on the river, which held one
young lady and several men.</p>

<p>The actress was, indeed, standing up in
the bow of the boat and, as Jan had said,
seemed about to jump into the river. One
man was rowing the boat, and the other, in
the stern, was moving forward as if to stop
the young lady from leaping overboard.</p>

<p>“This is great!” cried Ted, with shining
eyes.</p>

<p>“Awfully exciting,” admitted Janet.</p>

<p>“It’s like a circus,” said Trouble. “But
I don’t see any nellifunts! Where are the
nellifunts?”</p>

<p>Several persons standing near Mr. Martin’s
car laughed at this. But they quickly
looked away from the Curlytops and toward
the boat on the river as the young lady in
it gave a scream and leaped into the water,
making a great splash.</p>

<p>“Oh, my goodness!” cried Mrs. Martin.
“There’ll be a drowning after all!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>THE ALBUMS ARE GONE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">More</span> than one, at least in the crowd that
had gathered to watch the movie folk, was
almost as much excited as was Mrs. Martin,
when they saw the actress jump out of the
boat into the river. But Mr. Martin quickly
understood that it was all part of the work
of making moving pictures, and said:</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Mother! Don’t worry!”</p>

<p>“They’ll get her out!” added Ted.
“Look, there goes a man in after her now!”</p>

<p>As he spoke the man in the stern of the
boat threw off his coat and leaped with a
great splash into the water after the young
lady.</p>

<p>“And they’re taking pictures of it all the
while!” called out Jan. “Oh, I wish I could
see them on the screen!”</p>

<p>What Janet said was true—from the time
the boat started up the stream near the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
white bridge until the moment when the
young lady leaped out and the actor leaped
after her, men on the bank, and also men in
another boat, were quickly turning the
handles of their moving picture cameras,
filming every action of the actors and
actresses.</p>

<p>“Why do they have three cameras,
Daddy?” asked Janet, for she noticed at
least this number of men, with their caps
on backward, grinding away.</p>

<p>“There are two reasons for that,” answered
Mr. Martin. “One reason is that
one film might be spoiled, and if it was the
only one taken all the work would have to
be done over again. Another reason is that
the pictures give different views of the
same scene, and it can not be told, until after
the films are developed and printed, which
is the best. So they take two or three, the
same as a photographer takes more than
one picture of you when you go to his
studio.”</p>

<p>“Did they take more than one picture of
the little twin girls that died?” Janet asked,
pointing to where, in a box in the rear of
the auto, the two Cardwell albums had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
placed. “And did they take two pictures of
the boy who was lost at sea?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” her father
answered. “I suppose they did, though the
pictures were taken a number of years ago
when it wasn’t as easy to make photographs
as it is now. When those twin girls and
the Cardwell boy sat for their portraits,
moving pictures weren’t thought of—at
least, not as we see them now.”</p>

<p>“There—they’ve got her!” cried Ted, as
he saw the man from the boat reach the girl
who had leaped overboard. “She’s saved!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad of that,” remarked Mrs.
Martin, with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“But she wasn’t going to drown, anyhow!”
went on the Curlytop lad. “She
knew, all the while, that she’d be saved,
didn’t she, Daddy?”</p>

<p>“I guess she did,” Mr. Martin admitted,
with a smile. “These movie people don’t
take many chances. Of course, some of them
who do ‘stunts’ run into danger, but, in the
main, they are pretty careful. I guess this
young lady was a good swimmer.”</p>

<p>“They’re taking more pictures of her,”
cried Jan. “Look! She’s on the bank over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
there and they’re taking a lot more pictures
of her.”</p>

<p>“So they are,” agreed Mrs. Martin. “The
poor thing—they won’t even give her a
chance to get into dry clothes.”</p>

<p>“Probably the story of this movie doesn’t
call for that,” suggested Mr. Martin. “The
young lady may have to be shown coming up
from the water dripping wet.”</p>

<p>That seemed so, for as soon as the man
who had jumped from the boat into the
water after the actress began to carry her in
his arms up the bank of the creek, some of
the camera men ran around with their machines
and again began grinding very fast
at the handles.</p>

<p>“Oh, it must be wonderful to be a movie
actress!” sighed Jan.</p>

<p>“I’d like to be one of the cowboy actors!”
exclaimed Ted, looking at the men in western
costume, who, just then, did not seem to
have much to do. They were standing idly
about near their horses.</p>

<p>“Well, if being a movie actress means
jumping into a river with all your clothes
on, I beg to be excused,” laughed Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“I’m glad we came here,” said Ted.
“Aren’t you, Jan?”</p>

<p>“I just guess I am!” she murmured.
“Oh, look! Now she’s running away from
the man who saved her!”</p>

<p>Indeed, this very scene was then taking
place, and it caused some more excitement.</p>

<p>For the young lady, dripping wet as she
had been taken from the water, had rested
on the bank only a moment, while some pictures
of her and her rescuer were taken, and
then, with a scream, she broke away from the
man and rushed off across the meadow.</p>

<p>But it was all part of the play that was
being taken, for the Curlytops noticed that
the young lady was running straight toward
a camera that had been set up near a clump
of willow trees. And as she approached the
machine the man behind it kept it focused,
or “aimed,” as Ted said, straight at the
actress, picturing her every movement.</p>

<p>“I wish they’d take a picture of a nellifunt!”
sighed Trouble, and again his queer
remark caused a laugh.</p>

<p>“I guess they haven’t any elephants in
this outfit,” remarked a man standing near
the Martin auto.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose it’s all about?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
asked Mrs. Martin of her husband, as they
got out of the car and walked toward a group
of the picture people. “I mean what is the
story they are filming?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, and I doubt very much if
even those taking part in it know what it’s
all about,” said Mr. Martin. “You see,” he
explained, “in taking moving pictures they
make views of all the scenes that take place
in a certain spot all at once. That’s so they
won’t have to come back to it again. Now
they may take views of the cowboys here at
the bridge and also pictures of the girl in the
boat. But the cowboy scenes may be shown
at the beginning of the finished film, and the
scene we have just witnessed may be at the
very end. That’s how movie work is done.”</p>

<p>“Look, they’re going to take cowboy pictures
now!” cried Ted, as he saw some camera
men approaching a group of the horsemen.
And the cowboys, who had been idly
talking, now leaped to their saddles as if to
be in readiness for something.</p>

<p>“Yes,” remarked Mr. Martin, as he
glanced across the meadow, nodding to several
Cresco men whom he knew, “I think
they have finished filming the drowning lady
for the present. She may put on dry clothes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
and take part in some other part of the play.
Now we’ll watch the cowboys. They’ll make
it lively, I think.”</p>

<p>“Have we time to stay here and watch
this?” asked Mrs. Martin, as she followed
her husband and the children from the auto
out over the green meadow.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” he answered. “We are off on
a pleasure tour, you know, and this is giving
the children as much pleasure as anything
we could let them see. It is educational, too,
and this seems like a company of nice people.”</p>

<p>“Will it be safe to leave the car?” went
on his wife.</p>

<p>“Oh, surely!” laughed Mr. Martin. “No
one will run away with it. There are police
here,” and he pointed to some of the
Cresco force that had gathered to keep order
while moving pictures were being taken.
“Besides, I’ll lock it; then it will be safe.”</p>

<p>This he did, and then he took the Curlytops,
his wife, and Trouble over where they
would have a good view of what the cowboys
were about to enact.</p>

<p>“What company is this?” asked Mr. Martin
of Mr. Taylor, the feed merchant.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s one that makes funny films,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
was the answer. “Comedies, you know.
They have a studio in Mansfield, but they’re
out here just for the day. Quite a sight,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s interesting,” admitted Mr.
Martin.</p>

<p>“Your children are taking it all in,”
added Mr. Taylor, laughing.</p>

<p>“They don’t miss much,” admitted Mr.
Martin.</p>

<p>By this time, with the Curlytops and
Trouble in a place where they would have a
good view, that part of the play in which the
cowboys had a part began to be filmed.</p>

<p>One actor waved his hat and flapped it
against the sides of his pony, starting it off
at a fast gallop down the meadow. As he
rode along the children could see cameras
grinding away, taking pictures of this fast
ride. Then, after the first man, rode a number
of others. Now began a scene of great
excitement, for the cowboys chasing after
the one who had first ridden away began
firing their big revolvers and shouting at the
tops of their voices.</p>

<p>“My goodness!” cried Mrs. Martin, holding
her hands over her ears at the sounds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
of shooting. “I hope they aren’t firing real
bullets!”</p>

<p>“They’re only blank cartridges,” declared
Teddy. “Aren’t they, Daddy!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Oh, look!” suddenly cried Jan. “One
man fell off his horse!”</p>

<p>That actually happened to one of the riders
chasing after the lone cowboy. Off his
horse he rolled, tumbling over and over.
The pony got up after the fall and walked
about, beginning to eat grass as if nothing
had happened. The cowboy, also, picked
himself up and walked with a limp over to
get back on his steed.</p>

<p>“I’m glad he wasn’t hurt,” said Mrs.
Martin.</p>

<p>“Oh, he did that on purpose!” said Ted.</p>

<p>“I guess he did,” Mr. Martin agreed.
“They want to make the picture look as natural
as possible, so often the riders fall off
on purpose.”</p>

<p>“I should think they’d be hurt,” observed
the mother of the Curlytops.</p>

<p>“Cowboys know how to fall,” said Ted.
“Maybe I’m going to be a cowboy when I
grow up, and ride a bucking bronco.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“An’ maybe I’ll ride a nellifunt!” declared
Trouble.</p>

<p>After an exciting chase, which was all
taken in by the cameras, the cowboys quieted
down. This seemed to be the end of making
pictures for that time and in that place.
The actors and actresses hurried to waiting
automobiles, and the camera men began taking
the long-legged tripods from their machines.</p>

<p>“You picked a good spot to leave your
car, Mr. Martin,” said Mr. Taylor, as the
family was walking back to resume their
tour.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Your machine is right next to that of
Harry Portnay, the actor. That’s his car
there,” and Mr. Taylor pointed. “He’s getting
into it now. His car is the same make
as yours and the same kind.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that Mr. Portnay?” exclaimed
Mrs. Martin. “I’ve often seen him in the
films. How interesting! He was one of the
cowboys, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Mr. Taylor. “And he’s
very funny. He’s the one who fell off his
horse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“No wonder he knew how to fall!”
laughed Ted. “I like him!”</p>

<p>Indeed, Mr. Portnay was well known in
the films, and quite a favorite with boys and
girls. Ted and Janet had often seen the
Portnay pictures in the Cresco theater.</p>

<p>With wondering eyes at being this near to
a real movie actor, the Curlytops watched
Mr. Portnay get into his car and drive away
with others of his company who had come
to Cresco on location.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess the excitement is all over,”
remarked Mr. Martin, as the crowd began
leaving the field when the actors and camera
men had moved away.</p>

<p>“But we saw a lot, didn’t we, Jan?” asked
Ted.</p>

<p>“It was wonderful!” she returned. “I’d
like to see it all over again!”</p>

<p>“But we must start on our tour, if we’re
going,” said Mrs. Martin, as she lifted
Trouble into the car. “Come along, Curlytops.”</p>

<p>Mr. Martin looked over his machine, to
make sure everything was all right. He
counted the bags, valises, and other things
they had brought with him, and noted that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
the tent to be used for camping was on the
running-board.</p>

<p>Suddenly he gave a start of surprise and
asked his wife:</p>

<p>“Did you move that box of albums?”</p>

<p>“You mean the Cardwell albums?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It was in the back of the car. Did
you move it?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t touch it. I saw it there
when we got out, though.”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t there now!” exclaimed her
husband. “The Cardwell albums with the
old pictures in them are gone! I wonder
who could have taken them!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>ON THE TRAIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Curlytops, and Trouble also, were so
much taken up with watching the moving
picture people leave the meadow that for a
time they did not listen to what their father
and mother were talking about. But at last
Jan heard something said about the Cardwell
albums and asked:</p>

<p>“Did we lose them out of our car?”</p>

<p>“No; we had them when we parked here,”
answered her father. “I remember putting
the box under a robe, so it wouldn’t be in
plain sight. It could be mistaken for a
fancy box of lunch, I thought, and some
hungry boys, thinking it contained sandwiches,
might be tempted to take it.”</p>

<p>“Did they?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“Some one has taken the box with the
albums in it,” answered Mr. Martin. “It’s
gone!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“Let’s look again, to make certain,” suggested
his wife. “We don’t want to make a
fuss and then find the box, after all.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe we’ll find it,” replied Mr.
Martin, and there was a worried look on his
face. “It isn’t in the car—it’s been taken
out. And what to say to Mr. Cardwell I
don’t know! He will be very sorry to learn
that the albums are gone, for he never again
can get pictures of his twin girls who are
dead. And that sailor boy’s picture, too!
That’s gone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, perhaps we’ll find the box and the
albums,” said Mrs. Martin more cheerfully.
“No one would really steal them—they
would be of no value to any one.”</p>

<p>“No; and that’s what I can’t understand!”
complained the father of the Curlytops.
“But the albums are gone, sure
enough!”</p>

<p>It really seemed so, for when the children—even
Trouble helping—had looked
through the car, the box was not to be found.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know what to do,” said
Mr. Martin, walking up and down with a
worried air, beside his auto. “I don’t want
to go back and tell Mr. Cardwell we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
lost his valuable relics. And yet it isn’t fair
to him not to let him know.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he came here himself and got
them,” suggested Ted.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Son?” asked his
father.</p>

<p>“I mean that maybe after he gave them
to you he found out he was going to Bentville
himself, and he came here to tell you.
He didn’t see us, because we were looking
at the cowboys, and he just took the box out
of our car.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t do that without telling
me,” said Mr. Martin. “No, something else
happened. I wish I knew what. I’d like
to get those albums back.”</p>

<p>While Mr. Martin was still nervously pacing
up and down beside his auto and Mrs.
Martin was making another search among
the robes and valises for the box, one of the
cowboys who had taken part in the moving
picture rode past. Ted and Janet looked at
him with eager eyes, for he was a hero to
them.</p>

<p>Seeing the children, the actor smiled, and
then, noticing that something was wrong, he
stopped his horse, removed his big, broad-brimmed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
hat in a bow to Mrs. Martin and
asked:</p>

<p>“Is anything wrong? Can I help you?
Did some of our people bump into your car?
I know that sometimes happens when a
crowd gathers as we are taking films.”</p>

<p>“No, nothing like that happened,” answered
Mr. Martin. “But I left a box with
some valuable books in it here in my car, and
now the box is gone. I suppose some one in
the crowd thought it contained food and
made off with it. I wish they’d bring it
back, for the books are of no value except as
keepsakes to a family in Bentville where we
are going.”</p>

<p>“What sort of box was it?” asked the cowboy,
one of the last of the moving picture
actors to leave the green meadow near the
white bridge.</p>

<p>“It was a dark red wooden box, with inlaid
pieces of light wood,” Mr. Martin explained.
“It had a brass handle to carry it
by. It was a box I used to keep my papers
in at my store. But I had put these books
in it for safety. I might better have left
them out.”</p>

<p>“Was it a box about so long?” asked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
cowboy, holding his hands out about two feet
apart.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>“Then I know where it is!” exclaimed the
cowboy.</p>

<p>“You do?” cried Mr. and Mrs. Martin
together, while the Curlytops gazed at the
rider with eager eyes. As for Trouble, he
was gazing at the horse and murmuring:</p>

<p>“You aren’t as big as a nellifunt! I fed
a nellifunt peanuts once, I did!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know where your box is; or at
least, I know who took it,” went on the
actor. “It was all due to a mistake.”</p>

<p>“Who has it?” asked Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“I think you will find it in the car of Mr.
Harry Portnay, our head actor, or leading
man, as we call it,” replied the cowboy, with
a smile.</p>

<p>“What would he be doing with old photograph
albums?” asked Mr. Martin. “For
those are the books in the box—just old
photograph albums, though they contain
pictures highly valued by those who own
them.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Portnay didn’t want the albums,”
said the actor, who gave his name as Ned
Weldon. “But his helper, Jim Lewis, took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
them to him by mistake. Lewis thought
your box was Mr. Portnay’s make-up box.”</p>

<p>“Make-up box? Do you mean the box
with false mustaches and grease paint and
things like that in it?” asked Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the cowboy. Later Mrs.
Martin explained to the Curlytops that
actors when they “dress up” as different
characters must also change their faces as
well as their clothes. They must sometimes
put on powder and paint, as well as false
hair and beards. And each actor has what
is called a “make-up box,” consisting of
many things which enable him to make himself
up to look like some one else.</p>

<p>“This is how it happened,” went on Mr.
Weldon. “Your car was parked next to that
of Mr. Portnay. I remember seeing that as
I rode about taking part in the picture. He
has the same make and model car that you
have.</p>

<p>“During the cowboy race Mr. Portnay
happened to want something from his
make-up box. I heard him tell Lewis to go
and get it. I was sitting on my horse near
Mr. Portnay when Lewis came back with a
box such as you describe. At first it looked
a good bit like Mr. Portnay’s make-up chest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
but our leading man knew right away that
it wasn’t.</p>

<p>“Lewis, by mistake, had gone to your car
and taken your box of albums in place of
Portnay’s make-up box. Portnay laughed
at the mistake, and sent Lewis back to get
the right box.</p>

<p>“Now, in all probability, what happened
was this. Instead of putting the box of
albums back in your car, Lewis put it in
Mr. Portnay’s car and also took from that
car the make-up box. He left your box in
Mr. Portnay’s car and now our leading man
has gone away with it. That’s what happened
to your albums, I feel sure. No one
took them purposely.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it must have happened as you say,”
agreed Mr. Martin. “I’m glad to learn the
books weren’t stolen.”</p>

<p>“But how can we get them back?” asked
Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“The albums aren’t ours—we are carrying
them for a neighbor, Mr. James Cardwell,”
explained Janet primly.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it,” said the little Curlytop
girl’s father.</p>

<p>The cowboy actor looked at his watch and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
seemed to be trying to calculate something
in his mind.</p>

<p>“We’re to take more scenes on location,
as we call it, to-morrow,” he said.</p>

<p>“Do you mean here?” asked Mr. Martin.
“We planned to go on, but if it means getting
back the albums we can stay.”</p>

<p>“No, not here,” answered Mr. Weldon.
“Our next scenes will be taken at Cub Mountain,
about fifty miles from here.”</p>

<p>“I know where Cub Mountain is,” said
Mr. Martin. “I’ve been there, but I didn’t
intend visiting it on this tour. You see, we
are touring around for our summer vacation,”
he added.</p>

<p>“I see,” remarked Ned Weldon. “Well,
Mr. Portnay and the rest of the company,
or at least most of us, will be at Cub Mountain
this time to-morrow, or a little earlier.
We are taking scenes about a log cabin on
the mountain. If you are there you can
very likely see Mr. Portnay and get back
from him your box which his man took in
mistake for the make-up chest.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we catch Mr. Portnay before
then?” asked Mr. Martin. “I mean,
couldn’t we trail after him now and come up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
with him somewhere before he reaches Cub
Mountain?”</p>

<p>“You might try,” said the man who
played the part of a cowboy. “He is going
through Midvale, which is about halfway
there. Probably he’ll stop in Midvale all
night. He’ll be very sorry this has happened,
and he’ll be glad to give you back your
box.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied Mr. Martin.
“Then I think the best thing for us to do is
to take the trail after this Mr. Portnay. I
can get back the albums without having to
worry Mr. Cardwell about them. Come on,
children!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’s comin’,” murmured Trouble.</p>

<p>Into the auto scrambled the Curlytops and
Trouble. Mrs. Martin took her place beside
her husband, and, waving a farewell to the
cowboy actor, they started on the trail of
Mr. Portnay.</p>

<p>The green meadow by the white bridge
was now almost deserted. The curious ones
from the city of Cresco had left, and so had
the moving picture people, with the exception
of the actor who had solved the mystery
of the disappearance of the albums.</p>

<p>“Well, we are having rather an exciting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
start of our tour,” laughed Mrs. Martin, as
the auto rolled along the smooth road.
“First we meet these interesting moving picture
people, and then we have to chase after
them. It’s very exciting.”</p>

<p>“It’s lots of fun!” laughed Janet.</p>

<p>“I hope we see some more cowboy races,”
remarked Ted.</p>

<p>They rode on for several miles, and as
they went slowly around a bend in the road,
Trouble called out:</p>

<p>“Look! Look! Look at the monkey!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>OFF AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Trouble Martin</span> was not given to calling
out alarms like this; so, at first thought, his
mother imagined he was playing some sort
of joke.</p>

<p>“William, you mustn’t say such things!”
she exclaimed, with a little laugh, giving him
a playful shake. “There aren’t any monkeys
in these woods.” Just then they were
slowly passing along a road over which the
branches of big trees arched.</p>

<p>“You didn’t see any monkey!” cried Ted.
“If you saw anything it was one of your
‘nellifunts,’ Trouble.”</p>

<p>“I did see a monkey!” insisted the little
fellow. “There he is now. He’s swinging
in a tree!” and he pointed ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin was now running the auto
very slowly, for there was a bad place in the
road where it had been dug up. So there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
was plenty of time for them all to look where
Trouble pointed with his chubby finger.
Jan, the first to see something, cried:</p>

<p>“It is a monkey! Oh, look! He’s hanging
by his tail from a tree!”</p>

<p>Then they all saw it, and as Mr. Martin
stopped the machine just beneath the swaying
monkey, Mrs. Martin exclaimed:</p>

<p>“What in the world does it mean?
Trouble, I beg your pardon! You were
right, after all! I thought you were fooling.”</p>

<p>“He’s my monkey!” declared the little
fellow. “I saw him first! He’s mine!”</p>

<p>“If you can get him!” chuckled Ted.
“But I guess he’s going to stay up there out
of reach.”</p>

<p>“How do you suppose a monkey comes to
be in these woods?” asked Mrs. Martin of
her husband. “Could it have escaped from
a circus?”</p>

<p>“There’s nellifunts in a circus,” announced
Trouble, getting back to his favorite
subject.</p>

<p>“Yes, this little chap might have come
from a circus,” said Mr. Martin, with a
smile, as he looked up at the monkey, now
swinging above his head. “Or from some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
house. Some people have monkeys for
pets.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it belongs to the moving pictures!”
exclaimed Ted. “They have a lot
of animals in the pictures.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it was with Mr. Portnay’s
company,” Mrs. Martin remarked. “We
didn’t see any such animals there. But
what are we going to do about this one?”</p>

<p>“Guess we’ll have to leave him where he
is—up in the tree,” answered her husband.
“He can’t do much harm, and since it is
summer, he won’t suffer from the cold. If
winter was coming on he’d be a pretty sick
monkey—out in the open like this.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could have this monkey!”
pleaded Trouble. “I like a monkey better’n
I do a nellifunt, I guess!”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s quite a thing for you to
say!” laughed the little fellow’s father.
“But I’m afraid we can’t get you this for a
playmate. Hold fast, children, I’m going
to start.”</p>

<p>As he was about to let in the clutch and
send the car ahead, there appeared, running
around the bend in the road, an excited Italian
organ grinder with his music box. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
was running fast, and when he caught sight
of the auto he cried:</p>

<p>“You seena da monk? You seena da
monk?”</p>

<p>At this moment the monkey in the tree,
still swinging by his tail, began to chatter
shrilly. Doubtless he had caught sight of
his master and the organ to which tunes the
monkey danced. And as the monkey chattered
the Italian looked up, catching sight
of his pet.</p>

<p>“Ah, da monk! My leetle monk!” he exclaimed,
and then he talked in his own language.
After which he again spoke English,
saying: “Come down, Mickey! Come
down to papa!”</p>

<p>The children laughed at this, and the Italian
joined them in the mirth.</p>

<p>“He gooda da monk, but he run away,”
explained the man. “Da string, she break,
Mickey go ’way. Come down! Come
down!” he begged, holding out his cap.
“Come to papa!”</p>

<p>But the monkey did not appear to want
to come down. It turned right side up, no
longer swinging by its tail, but sitting on a
branch.</p>

<p>“If you had some peanuts he’d come down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
for those,” suggested Ted, searching
through his pockets, hoping to find a stray
“goober.”</p>

<p>“Mickey lika da peanut, but Mickey lika
da banan mooch better,” said the Italian.
“If I hada da banan, down queek he come.”</p>

<p>“I have a banana,” said Mrs. Martin. “I
bought some after we left the moving picture
place, and the children didn’t eat all of
them. Here’s a banana for Mickey,” she
added, handing to the Italian organ grinder
one of the yellow fruits.</p>

<p>“T’ank you,” murmured the man. Then,
peeling the banana, he bit off a little end of
it and held the remainder out so the monkey
could see it. “I no fool you,” the man murmured
to his pet. “Dese banana, he good!
See, I eat some of heem!”</p>

<p>Again he took a nibble as if to prove to the
watching monkey that the fruit was real and
good. And, seeing this, the monkey gave
another chatter and then began to climb
down the tree. Once he had made up his
mind to descend, he lost little time, and he
was soon perched on the organ eating the
banana while his master fastened to the collar
the little animal wore, the end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
string from which Mickey had broken
loose.</p>

<p>“Now you be da good monk and come
weeth papa!” said the organ grinder, at
which the Curlytops laughed again, the
Italian joining in.</p>

<p>“Mother, isn’t it funny for him to call
himself the monkey’s papa?” whispered
Jan.</p>

<p>“Rather funny, yes,” admitted her
mother. “But the Italians are like that.”</p>

<p>“I t’ank you for catcha da monk,” said
the Italian, taking off his hat and bowing
to Mrs. Martin, as Mickey finished the
banana. “Mebby I never no get heem if so
dat he not smell da banana.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad I had one to tempt him down
with,” replied the mother of the Curlytops,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Does your monkey act in moving pictures?”
asked Ted, as the traveler got ready
to move along.</p>

<p>“Da movie pitcher—no—no!” cried the
Italian. “Mickey he only hand-organ monk—no
movie da pitcher monk! Goo’-by!
T’ank you!”</p>

<p>“Good-by!” echoed the Curlytops and the
others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>Then Mr. Martin started his car along the
road while the Italian, glad that he had
recovered his pet which had run away from
him, went in the other direction.</p>

<p>“Well, another adventure on our tour,”
laughed Mrs. Martin. “I couldn’t imagine
what Trouble meant when he called out
about a monkey in the tree.”</p>

<p>“Neither could I,” said the little fellow’s
father. “I thought he was fooling.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to pay more attention to
Trouble after this,” said Ted.</p>

<p>“Next time he may see a bear!” laughed
Jan.</p>

<p>“Don’t like bears!” murmured the little
fellow, who was getting sleepy. “Like nellifunts
an’ monkeys, but not bears.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t believe we are likely to
meet any bears,” said Mr. Martin. “What
I would like to meet, though, is that moving
picture actor with the Cardwell albums.”</p>

<p>“We’ll find him at the hotel in Midvale
and get the albums back,” said his wife.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” her husband answered.</p>

<p>They were now on their way again. Since
Mr. Martin had made no special plans for
their touring vacation, he and his wife decided
that it would be as well to stop in Midvale<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
for the night, and go on in the morning,
as it would be to try to reach some more
distant place.</p>

<p>“Will we sleep in the tent at Midvale?”
asked Ted, when signs along the road showed
the Curlytops that they were entering that
small city.</p>

<p>“No, I think we’ll go to the hotel,” replied
Mr. Martin. “We have to stop at the hotel,
anyhow, to catch this movie actor, so we may
as well stay all night.”</p>

<p>“It would be more fun in the tent,” urged
Ted.</p>

<p>“Heaps more fun,” agreed his sister.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll have enough of tent life before
we finish this tour, children,” laughed Mrs.
Martin.</p>

<p>They reached the Midvale hotel about five
o’clock that afternoon. Mr. Martin told his
family to remain in the car until he went in
to make sure they could get rooms. He came
out a little later and there was a look of
disappointment on his face.</p>

<p>“Can’t they take us in for the night?”
asked his wife.</p>

<p>“Yes, we can stay here. But Mr. Portnay
isn’t here. I can’t get the albums from
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“Not here? Then, where is he?” asked
Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“He stopped here, but has gone on,” her
husband answered. “He has gone on to Cub
Mountain, and, I suppose, has the box of
albums in his car with him. Perhaps he
doesn’t know about them, and they may get
lost. I wish he had stayed here until I
came!”</p>

<small>AT THE FARM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> the young Curlytops did not think
much about the missing albums, they could
see that their father was worried because he
had not got them back from Mr. Portnay.
And anything that worried their father and
mother also worried Ted and Janet.</p>

<p>For they could see that Mr. Martin was
bothered by the failure to meet the moving
picture actor and get back from him the box
his man had taken by mistake, thinking it
contained false hair, false beards and make-up
paint.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” Mrs. Martin
asked her husband.</p>

<p>“I hardly know,” was his answer.</p>

<p>“Can’t you telephone or telegraph on
ahead to Cub Mountain and ask him to wait
for us, or to leave the box of albums where
we can get it when we arrive there to-morrow?”
Mrs. Martin asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“I might do that if I knew where to send
a telegram or where to telephone to Mr.
Portnay,” answered her husband. “That’s
what I should have done here—sent a telegram
to that actor at this hotel. He would
have received it and have left the box here
for me. But I didn’t think of that; so he
has gone on, taking my box with him. Very
likely, he doesn’t even know he has it; he is
so busy making this picture.”</p>

<p>“You say you can’t reach him at Cub
Mountain?” Mrs. Martin inquired.</p>

<p>“No, the people at this hotel say Cub
Mountain is only a small settlement, and that
there isn’t even a hotel there. If the moving
picture company doesn’t set up a camp,
Mr. Portnay will probably stop with some
friends or in a private boarding house.
There may be telephones in some houses or
cabins at Cub Mountain, but there is no telegraph
station there. The only thing to do
will be to go on there.”</p>

<p>“Now?” asked Ted, who was getting
hungry and who looked at the Midvale hotel
with longing eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, we won’t go on now,” replied his
father. “We’ll stay here for the night and
travel on to Cub Mountain in the morning.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
The roads aren’t any too good. I want to
travel them by daylight. Well, you may as
well get out and come in,” he told his wife
and children.</p>

<p>While Mrs. Martin was signing her name
to the hotel register, she listened to her husband
talking to the clerk about the moving
picture actor.</p>

<p>“Yes, he was here,” the clerk said; “he
and a number of his company. But the
crowd stayed only to eat and then went on.
I heard one of them say they had a lot of
scenes to take at Cub Mountain, and they
wanted to start the work early in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Did you see Mr. Portnay have a reddish
brown box, about so large?” inquired Mr.
Martin, showing the size of the little chest
containing the albums.</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t bring in any baggage,” was
the answer.</p>

<p>“Then it’s probably still in his car,” said
the Curlytops’ father. “I hope I can get it
back to-morrow.”</p>

<p>They went up to their rooms, Ted and his
father having one, with two beds in it, while
Mrs. Martin took Janet and Trouble in with
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“Better get ready to eat, children,” suggested
their father, as he noticed Ted and
Janet looking from the windows out across
the country, for Midvale was on the side of
a hill from which a good view could be had.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin washed Trouble, and put
clean clothes on him from the supply carried
in the valises, and thus he was first ready to
go down to the dining room. When neither
his father nor his mother noticed him he
wandered out into the hall.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Martin were ready to go
down, and so were Ted and Janet, when
Trouble’s mother looked around for him.</p>

<p>“Where’s William?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I saw him go out into the hall,” answered
Ted. “I’ll get him.”</p>

<p>As he opened the door to go into the hall,
the others following, they heard the tinkle of
broken glass, and then, directly afterward,
a bell began to ring.</p>

<p>Instantly, throughout the hotel, which was
not a very large one, there was a great commotion.
The elevator shot up to the floor
where the Martin family stood and the colored
boy in the cage cried:</p>

<p>“Come on! Git in! Ah’ll take yo’ all
down ’fore de place burns!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“Before the place burns? What do you
mean?” asked Mr. Martin. “The hotel isn’t
burning!”</p>

<p>“Yes, ’tis!” cried the colored elevator lad,
his eyes big with fright. “Doan yo’ all hear
de ’larm!”</p>

<p>“I do hear a bell ringing!” exclaimed
Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>There was more commotion in the hotel,
and several guests began running from their
rooms, carrying bags and clothing. It began
to look as if there was a fire, but there was
no appearance of flames, nor could Mrs.
Martin smell smoke.</p>

<p>Then Ted exclaimed:</p>

<p>“It was Trouble! He sent in a false
alarm! Trouble pulled the fire alarm!
Look!”</p>

<p>He pointed to the little fellow who was
climbing down from a chair in the hall. The
chair was some distance down the corridor,
and near a small red box fast to the wall.</p>

<p>In a moment Mr. Martin understood. He
had seen these fire signal stations in various
places about the hotel. In front of a small
iron box was a sheet of glass, and hanging
down from the box by a chain was a little
iron hammer. Directions on the box said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
to break the glass with the hammer and pull
down the hook inside, which could only be
reached when the glass was smashed.</p>

<p>“Trouble smashed the glass and pulled
the hook!” cried Ted.</p>

<p>“I heard some glass break,” added Janet.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin ran down the hall to the small
boy, who stood near the chair. On the carpet
were pieces of shattered glass.</p>

<p>“Trouble, did you do this?” cried his
father.</p>

<p>“I—now—I jist hit the glass a little wif
de hammer and it did break,” confessed
William. “Den I pulled on de button
hook!”</p>

<p>“Well, you did more than that!” exclaimed
his father, with a grim laugh. “You
sent in the alarm when you pulled the hook.
There’s no danger, my friends!” he called
to the guests who were crowding out into
the corridor. “There’s no fire. It was a
false alarm! I shall have to punish my little
boy for breaking the glass and sending in
a false alarm.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t punish him!” murmured a
lady, who in running from her room had
caught up a canary bird in a cage and a pair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
of old slippers. She hardly knew what she
was doing in the excitement.</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t mean to do it,” said a man.
Trouble, by this time, knew he had done
something dreadful, and was crying behind
his mother’s skirts.</p>

<p>Luckily, the alarm Trouble caused to be
sent in was only a private one, just in the
hotel itself. It did not bring the Midvale
fire department out, for word went to the
clerk downstairs that there was no danger
and he did not call out the engines or hook
and ladder apparatus.</p>

<p>So, after all, little harm was done, except
to cause some excitement and fright among
the hotel guests. But this soon passed, and
when the Martins went to the dining room
a little later, every one looked at Trouble as
a guest of some importance.</p>

<p>“But don’t ever do it again!” his mother
warned him.</p>

<p>“No’m, I won’t,” he promised.</p>

<p>The broken glass was swept up by one of
the chambermaids, and a new sheet put in
front of the hook in the fire alarm box.</p>

<p>That evening after dinner Mr. Martin
took his family to the moving picture theater
near the hotel. You can imagine how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
surprised they were when one of the pictures
proved to have been made by Mr. Portnay’s
company, and he himself took a large part
in it.</p>

<p>There, on the screen, the children saw the
very man they had watched act in the green
meadow that morning. Ned Weldon, the
cowboy actor with whom the children had
talked, was in it, too. Of course these were
not the scenes they had watched being filmed,
for that picture was far from being finished.
But it was very exciting to see the people
they had so recently watched.</p>

<p>“I wish Portnay were here in person instead
of only in the movies,” remarked Mr.
Martin, as they left the theater. “I’d ask
him for those rare albums. But I suppose
we shall have to wait until we meet him at
Cub Mountain.”</p>

<p>The next morning, after a quiet night, the
Curlytops resumed their tour, and made a
safe trip to Cub Mountain, on which was a
small country settlement. The scenery was
just wild enough to be the right background
for moving pictures.</p>

<p>“Where are you going to inquire about
Mr. Portnay?” asked Mrs. Martin, as her
husband stopped his car on what appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
to be the only, as well as the main, street of
the village.</p>

<p>“Right here in the post-office,” he answered,
for it was in front of the post-office
that they had stopped. “They’ll know here
about the moving picture people, I guess.”</p>

<p>But again Mr. Martin was doomed to disappointment.
For when he inquired of the
postmaster that official said:</p>

<p>“Yes, there was a company of movie people
here. But that was early this morning—about
three hours ago, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Have they left?” asked Mr. Martin,
wishing he had made an earlier start.</p>

<p>“Yes, they went on to the Dawson Farm.
They’re going to film some scenes there, so
I heard ’em say.”</p>

<p>“Where is the Dawson Farm?” asked
Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>“About ten miles from here. Keep
straight on and you can’t miss it. It’s a big
place—old-fashioned white farmhouse, red
barns, and all that. Just the thing for
movies, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I’ll go there,” said Mr. Martin,
and when he rejoined his family he said
to his wife:</p>

<p>“This Portnay actor keeps me on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
jump. I wish he’d stay in one place long
enough for me to get back those albums.”</p>

<p>“You’ll very likely catch him at the
farm,” said Mrs. Martin. “But perhaps it
would be as well to telephone from here and
say you are coming.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll do that,” the Curlytops’ father
said.</p>

<p>He went back into the post-office, where
he had noticed a telephone on the wall. But
when he asked if he could use it to send a
message to the Dawson Farm the postmaster
smiled and said:</p>

<p>“Well, you’re welcome to use it as far as
I’m concerned, but you can’t get Dawson’s
Farm on that machine.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t they a telephone?” Mr. Martin
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, they have a ’phone. But this
one here is out of order and it won’t work.
I’ve sent for a feller to fix it, but he hasn’t
come.”</p>

<p>“Is there another telephone here?” asked
Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>“No, this is the only one, and this is out
of order. I’m sorry!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, too,” Mr. Martin answered.
“I’d like to get a message through to Dawson’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
Farm, so Mr. Portnay won’t again
leave and take my box with him.”</p>

<p>However, there was nothing to do but to
hurry on to the farm as fast as they could
go. The postmaster explained that the place
was a real farm, not one for moving picture
purposes, though scenes were frequently
filmed there, as many farm animals were
ready to be photographed as a background
for the actors and actresses.</p>

<p>“It’s just like a game, isn’t it, Daddy?”
said Teddy.</p>

<p>“Like hide-and-seek,” added Janet, giggling.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” agreed Mr. Martin. “But I
don’t like playing the game very much.”</p>

<p>Down off Cub Mountain drove Mr. Martin
with his auto load of family, and after rather
a bumpy trip over rough roads he turned
onto a firm, smooth highway and soon they
read a sign which said it was but one mile
to Dawson’s Farm.</p>

<p>“There it is!” cried Ted, a few minutes
later, as they made a turn in the road. Before
them lay the big farm and buildings
spoken of by the Cub Mountain postmaster.
And, as the Martins drew nearer, Janet
cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>“I see the movie people! There they
are!”</p>

<p>She pointed to a number of persons, some
on horses and others on foot, who were, undoubtedly,
some of the same ones they had
watched in the green meadow.</p>

<p>“Now I’ll get those albums back,” said
Mr. Martin.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />

<small>TROUBLE’S DANGER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">This</span> is a dandy place!” exclaimed Ted,
as his father guided the auto into a lane that
led from the main road up to the group of
farm buildings.</p>

<p>“Indeed it is,” agreed Mrs. Martin. “I
should like to spend part of our vacation
here, if they would let us.”</p>

<p>“Look at the cows! Look at the cows!”
cried Trouble, pointing to a herd of fine
animals in a distant pasture.</p>

<p>“And what a lot of horses, too,” added
Janet.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin, however, was most interested
in the company of moving picture players
clustered around one of the buildings. He
was looking for a sight of Harry Portnay
who, by mistake, had taken the box of the
Cardwell albums.</p>

<p>As the auto came to a slow stop not far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
from the group of movie folk who were being
filmed in some scene, a man on a horse rode
up to the car.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mr. Martin!” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s Mr. Weldon!” exclaimed the
father of the Curlytops, as he recognized
the movie cowboy actor who had first given
the information about Mr. Portnay’s man
taking the album box by mistake.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m here again,” was the answer.
“I just got my costume on. They’re going
to shoot me and some of the other boys pretty
soon.”</p>

<p>“Shoot you!” cried Ted, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot—you youngsters don’t know
all the movie terms,” laughed Mr. Weldon.
“I mean they’re going to aim the moving
picture cameras at us and ‘shoot’ us that way—not
with guns!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” murmured Ted, laughing with the
actor. “Well, I’m glad they aren’t going to
shoot you with guns.”</p>

<p>“They shoot nellifunts with guns!” broke
in Trouble. “But if I had a nellifunt I
wouldn’t let ’em shoot him. And we saw a
monkey, we did!”</p>

<p>“My, that’s a fine thing to see!” chuckled
Mr. Weldon. “But I suppose you saw Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
Portnay and got back your box of valuable
hot cross buns, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t hot cross buns!” laughed
Janet, for this actor had a jolly way about
him. “It was <i>albums</i>—albums for pictures,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, so it was! Albums!” said Mr.
Weldon, with a smile. “I was just joking,
you know. But I suppose you got them
back?” he said to Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t,” was the answer. “That’s
why I came on here after them. I missed
Mr. Portnay in Midvale.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad,” returned the actor.
“You’re out of luck again.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” inquired Mrs.
Martin.</p>

<p>“Why, I mean Mr. Portnay isn’t here.”</p>

<p>“Not here!” echoed Jan’s father. “Why,
I thought this was his moving picture company
and that he’d surely be here. The postmaster
at Cub Mountain told me he had
come on here.”</p>

<p>“Some of us did after the scenes there
were taken,” explained the actor cowboy.
“But Mr. Portnay didn’t. He isn’t in these
pictures that are going to be taken at the
farm. Or, at least, he doesn’t come in until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
later. So, while this is his company, or the
company of which he is the star, he isn’t
needed just now; so he went back to New
York. He left just a little while ago to take
the train.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” exclaimed Mrs. Martin. “It
seems we are never going to catch up with
that man.”</p>

<p>“It is rather unfortunate,” said her husband.
“But perhaps he left my box here,”
he went on to Mr. Weldon. “He wouldn’t
take that back to New York with him.”</p>

<p>“No, he wouldn’t if he knew what it was,”
admitted the movie actor. “But he leaves
all such matters to his helper, Jim Lewis.
And Jim probably packed your box with the
other baggage belonging to Mr. Portnay
and shipped it to New York.”</p>

<p>“Is there any one here I could ask if the
box has been left?” inquired Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; our director, Tony Birch. He’d
know if any one would,” said Mr. Weldon.
“There he is over by the chicken houses.
They’re going to take a picture of Miss
Marcell feeding the hens, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Is Miss Marcell the young lady who
jumped into the river?” asked Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“Yes, the same one. She’s our leading
lady as Mr. Portnay is our leading man.”</p>

<p>“You stay here with the children, my
dear,” said Mr. Martin to his wife, “and
I’ll go and ask Mr. Birch if he knows anything
of my box of albums that Mr. Portnay
took. I’ll be right back.”</p>

<p>The Curlytops watched their father cross
a field and approach a group of movie folk
who were being filmed in some scene that had
to do with the fowls, of which there were a
large number on the Dawson Farm. From
where they sat in the auto the Curlytops and
their mother could see and hear something
of what went on. Trouble had gotten down
out of the car and was playing with a little
puppy at one side, so he was accounted for
for the time being.</p>

<p>As Mr. Martin approached the scene at
the chicken houses he could see Miss Marcell
tossing grain to the hens and roosters. In
front of her, and to one side of a movie
camera, was a man with a megaphone in his
hands. Through this he called directions to
the actress as the man at the camera ground
the crank.</p>

<p>“Not so fast! Not so fast!” cried Tony
Birch, for it was the director who was managing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
matters. “Don’t throw the chickens
corn so fast, Miss Marcell! You’ll make
them have indigestion. Do it slowly, as if
you were a girl on a farm.”</p>

<p>“All right,” was the smiling answer, and
she began to scatter fewer grains.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll have to give them more than
that or they’ll think you’re stingy!” exclaimed
the director. “There—that’s better.
Shoot!” he called to the camera man,
and the latter, who had ceased grinding out
the film while the actress was being corrected,
began again.</p>

<p>When the scene was over Mr. Martin
asked the director:</p>

<p>“Did Mr. Portnay leave behind him a red
box belonging to me? He took it by mistake
yesterday when you were at Cresco.”</p>

<p>The director thought for a moment and
answered:</p>

<p>“No, I am sorry to say he didn’t. Mr.
Portnay had to leave in a hurry to get back
to New York to arrange some matters, and
I suppose he didn’t think of your box.”</p>

<p>“It may be that he doesn’t even know he
has it,” explained Mr. Martin. “His man
Jim Lewis took it by mistake for a make-up
box.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>“Oh, I see. Um—yes. Well, I tell you
the best thing to do. Mr. Portnay will join
us here in about a week. He’ll be in New
York during that time. I can give you his
address and you can write or telegraph and
ask him to be sure and bring your box back
with you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. But won’t he return for a
week?” asked Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>“No. We have a number of scenes to film
here at the farm, and we are going to stay
for a week. They are scenes in which Mr.
Portnay has no part, so he isn’t needed here.
But when he comes back he can bring your
box.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that is the best I can do,” said
Mr. Martin, a bit disappointed. “But I am
touring around with my family. I didn’t
count on staying here a week.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good place to stay,” urged Mr.
Birch, with a smile. “We movie people have
engaged board here, and there is room for
more. Why don’t you stay with your family?
You’ll see some interesting sights.
We’re going to film a big part of the picture
here. And Dawson’s Farm is a good place
for a vacation.”</p>

<p>“So my wife said,” remarked Mr. Martin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
“Well, I’ll talk to her about it. The only
way to get back those albums seems to be to
get in touch with Mr. Portnay personally,
and I can best do that by staying here. The
children ought to like it,” he murmured, as
he looked over the big, pleasant farm.</p>

<p>“Why, certainly! By all means, stay!”
exclaimed Mrs. Martin, when told of the
situation. “We don’t have to travel on
until we get ready.”</p>

<p>“No,” agreed her husband. “And I certainly
must get those albums back or there
will be trouble in the Cardwell family.
Well, I guess the best thing to do is to stay.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goodie!” cried Janet, when she heard
this.</p>

<p>“Hurray!” shouted Ted.</p>

<p>“Will they be any nellifunts?” asked
Trouble.</p>

<p>“No. But there are lots of other animals,”
his mother said. “But will they keep
us here?” she asked her husband. “It’s a
delightful place, but with all these movie
folk here, will there be room for us?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Birch said so. But we can soon
make sure of it,” said the father of the
Curlytops.</p>

<p>Mr. Dawson, who owned and ran the big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
farm, was a jolly kind of man. He was
proud of his place, and one reason he consented
to let the movie people take scenes
of it was so that other persons, all over the
country, would see what a fine farm his was.</p>

<p>“They’re going to show a picture of me,
too,” said Mr. Dawson to Mr. Martin. “And
the name ‘Dawson’s Farm’ is to go in some
of the titles. We farmers ought to make the
world proud of us, and by showing movies
of a big farm like this city folks will think
more of the man who tills the soil.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you,” said Mr. Martin.
“But what about keeping us here?”</p>

<p>“Plenty of room! Plenty!” laughed Mr.
Dawson heartily. “And you say you have
two children?”</p>

<p>“Three,” answered their father.</p>

<p>“Three! So much the better! I love children!
Bring ’em in! My wife will want to
see them! She loves children, too!”</p>

<p>So it was settled that the Martin family
was to remain at Dawson’s Farm until Mr.
Portnay came from New York, or else
shipped back the box of albums. Mr. Dawson
kept quite an establishment, having a
number of hired men and servants, and he
took the Curlytops and their family right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
into his own house. The movie people
“camped” out by themselves in a separate
building. They would do their own cooking
and look after themselves. But the Martins
would eat with the Dawson family.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a lot of fun we can have here!”
cried Jan, after she and her brothers had
put on “old clothes” and were romping
about. Mr. Martin had gone to write a letter
to Mr. Portnay which that actor would receive
in New York. Mrs. Martin was talking
to Mrs. Dawson, who was a kind, motherly
soul with no children of her own.</p>

<p>“I know just how you feel, losing that
album with those little girls’ pictures in it,”
she said. “It’s worse than if it was your
own, belonging to some one else that way.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what Mr. Martin thinks,”
said his wife. “Well, we hope we’ll get it
back.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, too. Now I want the children
to have a good time. Let them do just as
they please.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t quite do that,” replied Mrs.
Martin, with a smile. “Though they’ll
pretty nearly do that, anyhow,” she added.</p>

<p>If she could have seen Janet and Ted
then she would have had reason to add to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
this, for the Curlytops were climbing an
apple tree, where Ted had seen some fruit
that looked nearly ripe.</p>

<p>“I’ll climb up and shake some down to
you, Jan,” he had said.</p>

<p>“You needn’t, thank you,” laughed Janet.
“I can climb a tree as well as you can!”</p>

<p>“You can not!” declared her brother.</p>

<p>“I can so! I’ll show you!”</p>

<p>Toward the tree ran the Curlytops, and
while they were climbing it Trouble was
doing something else. He had wandered off
by himself, though Mrs. Martin had told Jan
and Ted to look after him. Going down a
path that led away from the orchard, he
came to a field in which was pastured an old
boar, a savage pig with long, curving tusks—teeth
that stuck out like the tusks of an
elephant.</p>

<p>The sight of these tusks, small as they
were, made Trouble think the boar might be
a small animal of the kind he was so interested
in.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a little nellifunt! It’s a little
nellifunt!” cried Trouble. “I’m going in
an’ give him a peanut!” for he had asked
his mother to buy him some nuts just before
reaching Dawson’s Farm and he had a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
of the goobers left. “I give you peanut, little
nellifunt!” cried Trouble, as he crawled
in between two strands of the prickly wire
fence. His waist caught and was torn a little,
but he didn’t mind that.</p>

<p>The boar gave a grunt as he saw Trouble
enter the field. The boar wasn’t used to this.
He didn’t very often have company, especially
small boys. And the boar was savage—he
didn’t like company of any kind! The
only things he was afraid of were dogs and
a man with a sharp pitchfork or a big stick.</p>

<p>So, as soon as Trouble crawled through
the fence, the savage boar, with loud grunts,
made a rush for the little fellow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>FUNNY FISH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the boar, with deep grunts, started
toward Trouble, the little boy saw that he
had made a mistake. It wasn’t a little
“nellifunt” at all.</p>

<p>“’Cause he didn’t have any trunk—that’s
how I knew he wasn’t a nellifunt,” Trouble
explained to his mother afterward. “He
had big teeth, like a little nellifunt, but he
didn’t have any trunk.”</p>

<p>As soon as he had discovered it wasn’t a
small elephant in the field, Trouble began
to be afraid. He didn’t exactly know what
sort of animal this might be. Dimly he remembered
something about pigs on his
grandfather’s farm. But those pigs were
cute little pink ones in a pen with their big,
fat mother pig. The mother pig lay on her
side and grunted. The little pigs ran around
squealing. None of them acted as did this
savage boar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>For that reason Trouble didn’t know exactly
what to make of this. He held out in
his hand some of the peanuts he had taken
from his pocket. In the distance Trouble
could hear the shouts of Jan and Ted as they
scrambled up the apple tree. But more
clearly than anything Trouble heard the
grunts of the boar as it came nearer and
nearer.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t like you! Go on ’way!” called
Trouble, after a second of watching this big,
ugly animal. “Go ’way!”</p>

<p>But the boar still came forward. He was
used to having his own way except when a
man with a dog or a pitchfork came in the
field. More than once this boar had chased
boys and girls who, unthinkingly, had wandered
to this part of Mr. Dawson’s farm.
Mr. Dawson always warned people about
going into the field where the boar was, but
he had been so busy with the movie folk that
he forgot about it this time.</p>

<p>Suddenly the boar gave such a loud grunt
of rage, ending with such a squeal, that
Trouble was badly frightened. The little
fellow began to cry. He wished he hadn’t
come into the field.</p>

<p>The cry of their little brother reached the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
ears of Ted and Jan in the tree. They had
just begun to pick some of the fruit, but
when they heard Trouble they looked toward
him. And what Ted saw made him drop an
apple after he had taken one bite. He
scrambled down out of the tree shouting:</p>

<p>“I’m coming, Trouble! I’m coming! I
wont let the pig bite you!”</p>

<p>For Ted knew that boars are very savage
when once roused.</p>

<p>“I’m coming, too!” cried Jan.</p>

<p>She tried to scramble down out of the
tree, but slipped when on the lowest limb and
fell to the ground. Luckily she fell in a
place where the grass was long and thick, so
she wasn’t hurt. She was merely jarred a
bit, and after getting back her breath she
ran toward the fence, through which Ted
was crawling to reach Trouble.</p>

<p>By this time the boar was close to the little
fellow. Long before this the savage pig
would have rushed at the small boy, but,
truth to tell, the way Trouble stood there,
crying, puzzled the boar. And when animals
are puzzled they don’t act as quickly as when
they know just what is going on.</p>

<p>However, neither Ted nor Janet would
have reached Trouble in time to save him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
For as Ted got through the barbed wire
fence, which alone prevented the boar from
getting out of the pasture, there was a thud
and rush of feet and a voice shouted:</p>

<p>“I’ll get him! Stand still, little boy!”</p>

<p>The rush of feet were the galloping hoofs
of a horse. And the voice was that of Mr.
Weldon, the movie actor. He rushed his
steed toward the fence, called to his mount,
and, in another moment, the horse sprang
cleanly over the fence and rushed on toward
the boar. But more particularly Mr. Weldon
guided his steed toward Trouble.</p>

<p>As the little fellow turned to see whence
came the pounding of hoofs and the cheery
call of the man, the rider leaned from the
saddle and in one hand picked up small
William, swinging him up in front and to
safety. All the while the horse was going
at top speed.</p>

<p>In another moment Mr. Weldon had
leaped his animal back over the fence, and
the boar was left alone in the field, doubtless
wondering, in his small brain, what had become
of that boy he was going to gash with
his tusks.</p>

<p>“There you are, little man!” said Mr.
Weldon, as he brought his horse to a slow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
pace and set William on the ground near
Ted, who had crawled back through the
fence. “I wouldn’t go in that field again, if
I were you.”</p>

<p>“I should say not!” cried Ted, who had
been surprised with the quickness of it all.
“What made you go in there, Trouble?”</p>

<p>“I—now—I thought he was a little nellifunt,
an’ I was going to give him peanuts!”
sobbed the little chap, for he wasn’t yet over
his fright.</p>

<p>“Oh, elephant! He’s crazy about elephants!”
explained Jan, who came up just
then. “I guess he thought the big teeth on
that pig were elephant’s teeth.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” said Mr. Weldon. “But
keep watch of him, so he doesn’t go in there
again.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we will,” promised Ted.</p>

<p>“And thank you for saving Trouble,”
added Jan.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, thank you!” murmured Ted,
who had been so taken up with admiring
Mr. Weldon’s horse and the manner in which
the cowboy made his steed jump the fence
that he had little room to think of his manners.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said the movie man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
with a smile. “We have to do harder things
than that when we’re on the ‘lot.’ Well,
I’ll see you later,” and he rode back to join
the others, for the camera men were getting
ready to film certain scenes down near one
of the barns.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Martin also thanked Mr.
Weldon that night, after they had heard how
he had gotten Trouble out of danger. The
Curlytops and their friends were now well
settled at the farm, where they would remain
about a week.</p>

<p>“Though if Mr. Portnay sends back that
box of albums any sooner, we might travel
on,” said Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s stay here!” pleaded Jan. “It’s
lovely here!”</p>

<p>“We can have lots of fun,” added Ted.</p>

<p>“Well, since we started this tour mainly
to give you children a good vacation time,
and since you like it here, we might as well
stay for a while,” said their father.</p>

<p>“But you must take better care of
Trouble,” their mother warned them. “I
shan’t feel easy in my mind unless you
promise to watch him all the while he is with
you. With these movie folk here at the farm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
there is so much going on that Trouble may
easily get into danger.”</p>

<p>“We’ll take good care of him,” promised
Jan.</p>

<p>“I’ll take him with me wherever I go,”
said Ted.</p>

<p>“Well, then I’ll feel better about it,” said
Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>It was because of his promise that the next
day, when Ted and Janet decided to go fishing,
Ted called:</p>

<p>“Come on, Trouble! You may come with
us!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I like fishin’!” declared the little
boy. “I’m going to catch a big one.”</p>

<p>“I’ll leave him to sit on the bank near
you,” whispered Ted to his sister, “and I’ll
go off a little way by myself. I never can
catch any big fish if I’m near him, for he’ll
be pulling his hook in all the while to see if
he has a bite.”</p>

<p>“I know he will,” said Janet. “I’ll take
care of him while you fish.”</p>

<p>Not far from the farmhouse was a stream
winding in and out among a grove of trees.
In some places there were deep pools and
eddies where, some of the farmhands said,
large fish could be caught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>Ted picked out what he thought was a
good spot and, posting Jan and Trouble a
little way from it, cast in his hook.</p>

<p>He was sitting on a grassy bank near one
of the deep pools spoken of by some of the
farm hired men. Here the water had worn
out a place in the shore, making what is
called an eddy—a quiet, swirling bit of the
stream where big fish love to swim.</p>

<p>Ted had not been fishing long when he felt
that he had a bite.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve got a big one!” he called to Jan,
who was busy keeping Trouble from falling
into the stream. “I’ve got a whopper!
Look, Jan!”</p>

<p>He pulled up. Something black went sailing
through the air over his head. But no
sooner had it landed than Ted found he had
hooked an old rubber boot!</p>

<p>“Oh, jinks!” he cried in disgust. “Look
at that!”</p>

<p>“That’s a funny fish!” laughed Jan.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll get a real one this time!” declared
her brother.</p>

<p>In he cast again. There came a gentle
tug on his line.</p>

<p>“Now I’ve got a bite!” he shouted. Again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
he pulled up. Something flopped on the
grass behind him.</p>

<p>But it was only an old shoe!</p>

<p>“Say, what’s the matter here, anyhow?”
demanded Ted.</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” laughed his sister. “What
funny fish!”</p>

<p>“Look at Ted’s funny fish!” chuckled
Trouble.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>FLIP-FLOPS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pulling</span> up a rubber boot in place of a
fish wasn’t strange for the first time, since
Ted had before this done much the same
thing when out for a day’s sport. But when,
the second time, he hooked an old shoe, it
was too much!</p>

<p>If he had been fishing with some of the
Cresco lads he would have suspected a trick,
for often one of them would slip away, reach
for a chum’s hook in a spot where he couldn’t
be observed, and fasten on the hook some
queer object, putting it softly back into the
water again and waiting for the fun that was
sure to follow.</p>

<p>But Ted knew none of his chums were
with him now, and Janet, though she sometimes
played tricks, was too far away, looking
after Trouble, to have put the boot and
shoe on his hook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“Of course I might have picked them up
off the bottom, but I don’t believe it,”
thought the Curlytop lad. “I’m going to
watch.”</p>

<p>“I got a better fish than yours!” boasted
Trouble, holding up a small “sunny,” which
had rashly nibbled at his hook.</p>

<p>“So you did,” admitted Ted. “But I’ll
get a big fish soon.”</p>

<p>“That was <i>big</i> enough!” laughed Janet,
pointing to the rubber boot, from a hole in
the toe of which water was running.</p>

<p>“But it isn’t real,” said Ted ruefully.
“Just you wait!”</p>

<p>When Janet went back to the comfortable
place she had picked out for herself and
William, Ted again took his position on the
jutting-out bank near the deep eddy. Once
again he threw in his line, letting out plenty
of it. But this time, instead of gazing off
at the distant hills, Ted kept watch of his
tackle. Presently he saw it begin to move
in toward the shore at a place where tall
grass and rushes made a secret hiding place.</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” said Ted to himself. “If
a fish was on my hook a fish would move out
toward the middle of the brook—not toward
the bank.” For this is true of fishes. Once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
hooked, they try to get into deep water,
hoping to get the sharp point out of their
mouth.</p>

<p>But Ted’s line was being slowly pulled in
toward the grass-screened bank, and it
wasn’t at all as if a fish was hooked.</p>

<p>“It might be a mud turtle,” thought the
lad. “A turtle would go slow like that—but
not a fish. I’ll wait and see what happens.”</p>

<p>His line was pulled in a little farther toward
the bank. There was a movement in
the tall grass and the lad felt a tug on his
pole as if a fish were nibbling. It was just
like the other two “bites” he had.</p>

<p>“Now to see what it is!” thought Ted.</p>

<p>But instead of calling to his sister to look
what a big “fish” he had, the lad kept quiet
and began to haul in.</p>

<p>Something heavy was on his hook, that
was certain. But when he hauled it up out
of the water all that met his eyes was—an
old rusty tin can!</p>

<p>Janet looked up in time to see it sailing
through the air and she cried, as well as she
could for her giggles:</p>

<p>“Oh, Teddy! what’s the matter with you?
More funny fish!”</p>

<p>“It’s a trick—that’s what it is!” declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
the Curlytop lad. “A trick. Somebody
down there in the grass is putting boots and
shoes and tin cans on my hook!”</p>

<p>Dropping his pole, Ted made a dash for
the clump of tall grass and rushes where he
had seen the cautious movements. Before
he reached the place there was a commotion
there, and out and up leaped a queer little
man—a man who shouted and laughed and
at once began turning somersaults on the
open place a little way back from the edge
of the stream.</p>

<p>Backward and forward the queer little
man turned somersaults. Then he sprang
up in the air, landed on his hands, and
bounced back to his feet. With a whoop he
turned a “cartwheel,” and then rolled over
and over in the grass.</p>

<p>“Oh, look! He’s doing flip-flops! He’s
doing flip-flops!” cried Trouble who, with
Jan, had risen from his fishing place to look
at the funny man. “He’s doing flip-flops
like the nellifunt man in the circus!”</p>

<p>Indeed, this odd character seemed to have
come from a circus, except that he did not
have on a gayly colored suit with shining
spangles.</p>

<p>As Ted watched the thought came into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
lad’s mind that this strange man was the one
who had fastened the boot, the shoe and the
tin can on the fish hook.</p>

<p>“Whoop-la! That’s the way to do it!”
cried the man in a jolly voice, as he walked
around on his hands. He then very suddenly
straightened up. “How’s fishing?”
he asked, as he walked toward Ted.</p>

<p>“Why, it isn’t so very good—not with you
around.” When Ted said this, which might
not be considered very polite, a smile came
to his face. One could not help smiling when
one looked at the jolly countenance of the
“flip-flop man” as Trouble called him.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! So I spoiled your fishing, did
I?” asked the acrobat.</p>

<p>“Somebody did,” declared Ted. “That’s
all I caught.” He pointed to the rubber
boot, the shoe, and the rusty tin can on the
grass.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! That’s too bad! Too bad!”
sighed the funny man. “And there’s good
fish in here, too. I know it, for I’ve pulled
them out. Suppose you try again.”</p>

<p>“I will if you’ll stay up here and not go
down there to put things on my hook,”
agreed Ted, pointing to the clump of tall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
grass near the water’s edge, whence the man
had come.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho! So you suspect me, do you?”
asked the tumbler.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do!” laughed Ted. “Didn’t you
do it?”</p>

<p>“I’m like George Washington. I must
tell the truth,” said the man. “I did it. I
hope I didn’t bother you. It isn’t too late
to catch some real fish. Come on—throw in
again. I’ll sit here on the bank and keep as
quiet as a little mouse. Did you ever see a
little mouse?” he asked Trouble, winking
first one eye and then the other at the small
boy.</p>

<p>“I—now—I saw a nellifunt,” was Trouble’s
answer.</p>

<p>“Hum! Then you must belong in the circus
where I came from,” laughed the man.</p>

<p>“Oh, are you from the circus?” asked Jan
eagerly.</p>

<p>“I used to act in one—doing flip-flops and
other clown work,” answered the man.
“Now I’ve joined the movies. I’m Jimmie
Tizzy!”</p>

<p>“Oh, are you Jimmie Tizzy?” cried Ted,
for well he knew that name, having laughed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
more than once at the funny antics of this
clown of the movies.</p>

<p>“That’s who I am,” the man replied, with
a laugh.</p>

<p>“You don’t look like him,” ventured Jan
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“That’s because I haven’t my make-up
on, nor dressed as you generally see me,”
said Mr. Tizzy. “But if you stay around
here long enough you’ll see me as I really
am. I’m going to have a part with Mr.
Portnay next week.”</p>

<p>“Oh, are you stopping here at the farm,
and are you with Mr. Portnay’s movie company?”
cried Ted.</p>

<p>“That’s right!”</p>

<p>“We haven’t seen you before, and we’re
staying at the farm, too,” said Jan.</p>

<p>“There are so many of us, it’s no wonder
you missed me,” said Mr. Tizzy. “I really
haven’t done any acting for the camera since
we came here. My part doesn’t get filmed
until next week. But I wanted to keep in
practice, so I came out here to do a few flip-flops.
Then I saw you fishing and I thought
it would be fun to play a little joke on you.
I hid in the deep grass, pulled your hook in
with a long stick and fastened the boot on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
first. Then I put on the shoe and lastly the
tin can. Did you mind it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” admitted Ted, with a laugh.
“At first it puzzled me. But it’s all right.
I hope I can catch some real fish now.”</p>

<p>“I think you can,” said Mr. Tizzy. “I
won’t play any more jokes.”</p>

<p>Ted baited his hook anew and prepared
to cast in again, while the funny acrobat
sat down on the bank near the Curlytop lad
to watch him.</p>

<p>“Come on, Trouble,” said Jan, in a low
voice. “We’ll let Ted catch a big fish for
us.”</p>

<p>But Trouble didn’t want to go. He
dragged and held back.</p>

<p>“Wait! Wait!” he begged. “I want to
ast him suffin!”</p>

<p>“What is it, little man?” inquired Mr.
Tizzy, with a smile. “Do you want me to
stand on my head again? I’d better not
until your brother catches a fish. But what
else do you want to ask me?”</p>

<p>“Can you do flip-flops on a nellifunt’s
back?” inquired Trouble.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve done that,” admitted Mr.
Tizzy. “If you’ll bring your elephant here
I’ll flip-flop on his back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“I hasn’t got a nellifunt,” admitted the
little lad. “But maybe I could find one in
the woods. Once I gave a nellifunt peanuts.”</p>

<p>“And he’s never forgotten it!” laughed
Jan. “But come on,” she urged her small
brother. “Ted wants to fish. Maybe Mr.
Tizzy will do some other tricks for you,” she
added.</p>

<p>“I surely will,” promised the acrobat.
“I must keep myself in practice ready for
the work next week. Now go ahead and fish,
Ted.”</p>

<p>When it grew quiet, the lad eagerly waited
for a nibble, and he was soon rewarded by
pulling up a good-sized fish.</p>

<p>“It’s a real one this time!” Ted shouted,
as the beauty flopped on the grass.</p>

<p>“I must watch him,” said Mr. Tizzy. “I
may get some ideas from the way he leaps
about.”</p>

<p>From then on Ted had good luck and
caught five fish before it was time to go home.
Trouble, also, caught a fair-sized perch,
which much delighted him.</p>

<p>“Now for a few more flips and I’ll walk
back with you,” said Mr. Tizzy. “I’m glad
to know we’re stopping at the same place.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
I heard some talk last night about children
being at the farm, but I thought they meant
movie children.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re sort of on the move,” explained
Ted. “We’re touring around for
our vacation. But Mr. Portnay took two
old photograph albums by mistake, and
we’re waiting for him to send them back.”</p>

<p>“Go on—do a flip-flop!” urged Trouble
eagerly. “I like ’em!”</p>

<p>“All right. Here goes, little man!” cried
Mr. Tizzy.</p>

<p>He began turning somersaults again, leaping
back and forth, doing handsprings and
cartwheels on a smooth place in the grass.</p>

<p>“Now watch this!” he cried, and he bent
himself in the shape of a hoop by grasping
his ankles with his hands. Around and
around he rolled, the children laughing in
glee until, all at once, Mr. Tizzy disappeared.</p>

<p>Out of sight he vanished, as though the
earth had opened and swallowed him!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>TED FALLS OFF</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a while the Curlytop children and
Trouble thought this sudden vanishing of
Mr. Tizzy was one of his tricks—he was so
full and bubbling over with them. Ted said
afterward he thought the movie man had
doubled himself up into as small a ball as
possible and was hiding behind a clump of
grass.</p>

<p>But when nearly a minute passed and Mr.
Tizzy did not come back, the children began
to get worried. A trick and a joke might
be all right, but this was a little too much!</p>

<p>“Maybe he hurt himself,” suggested Jan.</p>

<p>This very thought was in Ted’s mind, but
his sister spoke of it first.</p>

<p>“Let’s look and see where he is,” went on
Jan.</p>

<p>“He went down in a hole!” declared
Trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>Certainly it looked so, and when Ted
walked forward, toward the place where he
had last seen the acrobat and when Janet
and Trouble followed, the Curlytop lad
found that what his little brother said was
true.</p>

<p>There was a hole in the ground, a rather
deep and steep hole with grass growing close
to the edge of it. And down in this hole lay
the acrobat in a huddled heap.</p>

<p>So still and quiet he was, all doubled up,
that Janet felt frightened. She was going
to ask Ted if he thought the jolly man might
be dead. But Ted suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I guess he’s fainted. I’ll get some water
and pour it on him.”</p>

<p>Ted had once seen his aunt faint, and his
mother had dashed water on her face.</p>

<p>Back to the stream ran the boy, and in the
can he had fished out he brought back some
water. When some of this had been spilled
on the face of the man lying in the hole, he
opened his eyes and asked rather faintly:</p>

<p>“What happened?”</p>

<p>“You flip-flopped into a hole,” answered
Ted. “Can you get out or shall I run back
to the farm for help?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess I’m all right now,” was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
answer. “I remember now. I was cartwheeling
around and, all of a sudden, I saw
this hole in front of me. Before I could stop
myself I rolled into it. I hit my head on a
stone, and that’s all I remember. But I’m
all right now, though I guess I was unconscious
for a minute or two.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t know what had happened to
you,” remarked Janet.</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t anything to worry about,”
said the man, as he untangled himself, for
his legs and arms were rather mixed up.
“I’ll be all right in another minute.”</p>

<p>He scrambled out of the hole, gave himself
a shake to make sure no bones were
broken, and then went down to the edge of
the little river, where he bathed his head,
especially the place that had hit a stone, and
drank some water.</p>

<p>“Now I feel better,” he announced. “But
I guess I won’t do any more flip-flops right
away.”</p>

<p>“What do you think made that hole?”
asked Ted, as they stood around the edge,
looking down in it, after Mr. Tizzy said he
thought they had better start back to the
farm.</p>

<p>“Some boys may have dug it for a cave to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
play in, or some one may have dug a big
stone out of there,” said the acrobat. “But
if they took a stone out, where it is I can’t
see,” and he looked around in vain for a
sight of the bowlder. “More likely it was
boys at play,” he said. “But it was dug
some time ago, for the grass has grown all
around the edge and the dirt they took out
has disappeared.”</p>

<p>Glad that nothing more serious had happened,
the Curlytops started back toward
the group of farm buildings. Ted carried
the fish he had caught, and Trouble insisted
on bringing home his small sunny and the
perch, neither of which were of much account
for the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a fine fisherman you are, William!”
his mother exclaimed, when she saw
what he held up for her to admire. “Why,
you’ll soon be able to catch enough for a
whole meal.”</p>

<p>“I caught a fish before Ted did,” announced
the little lad. “He got a rubber
boot!”</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Martin laughed at the story
of the funny trick played on Ted by the flip-flop
man, and a little later that day they met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
the actor and talked to him, liking him very
much.</p>

<p>While Mr. Martin was waiting for an
answer to the letter he had sent to New
York, asking Mr. Portnay to return the
photograph albums taken by mistake, there
was nothing to do save to amuse himself as
well as he could at the farm and make the
best of matters.</p>

<p>The moving picture actor might ship the
box of albums back by express, or he might
bring them himself, so Mr. Weldon said.</p>

<p>“Harry Portnay is a queer chap,” said
the cowboy actor who had leaped his horse
over the fence to save Trouble from the ugly
boar. “He never does what you think he
will. It would be just like him to send a
special messenger back with those books, or
he may even forget all about them and leave
them in his New York office.”</p>

<p>“But I have written him a letter about
them!” exclaimed Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. But he gets a lot of letters
every day—all movie stars do—and he may
not pay much attention to yours.”</p>

<p>“I must get those albums back if I have
to go to New York for them myself,” declared
the father of the Curlytops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“Oh, I’d like to go to New York!” cried
Ted.</p>

<p>“So would I!” added his sister.</p>

<p>“We have made other plans,” their
mother answered, with a smile. “We are
going to tour around and make a stop in
Bentville—as soon as we get the albums.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the only thing to do was to
wait, and it was a pleasant waiting, at least
for the children. They liked it at the Dawson
Farm, for there was much to see and do,
especially with the moving picture people
there. Every day some scenes were taken—nothing
very elaborate or big, because of the
absence of the star, but enough to keep the
camera men and the actors and actresses
busy.</p>

<p>To their delight, the day after the queer
fishing trip the children saw Mr. Tizzy do
some of his funny tricks in front of the camera.
The acrobat said he was all right again
after his tumble into the hole, and he certainly
was lively enough, leaping here and
there.</p>

<p>One afternoon Mr. Birch, the director,
walked over to the Martin family, who were
all sitting under a shade tree. The director
seemed to have something on his mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“Did your children ever act in the
movies?” he asked Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they ever did,” was the
answer.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Daddy, I did, once!” cried Ted.</p>

<p>“You did! Where?” asked his mother,
for she did not remember any such happening.</p>

<p>“Why, they took pictures of a baseball
game in Cresco once,” went on the Curlytop
lad. “I was there in the grandstand. They
took pictures of the people in the stand and
they took mine. I saw myself in the movies
afterward.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I do remember that,” said Mrs.
Martin. “But that wasn’t really acting.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can give them a chance now, if
you’ll let them take it,” said the director.
“One of our writers has made a change in
this story we are filming, and we need three
child characters in it for a short scene. If
you’ll let your Curlytops and their little
brother take part, it will be a big favor
to us.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any objection,” replied Mr.
Martin, as his wife looked at him. “What
do you want them to do?”</p>

<p>“I want them to ride on the back of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
pony,” explained the movie director. “Mr.
Dawson has a very safe pony, and I’d like
to have the children shown crossing a
meadow where the pony is pastured. They
have been after berries, we’ll say. On the
way back they want some fun, so they ride
on the pony’s back—all three of them.
We’ll take pictures of them doing that.”</p>

<p>“Three of them on one pony? Maybe the
pony wouldn’t like it,” said Mr. Martin,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, the pony won’t mind,” the director
assured him.</p>

<p>So it was arranged, and the next morning
the three children went to the pasture, followed
by some of the movie people and two
camera men. Mr. Dawson had given permission
to use the pony.</p>

<p>“Now don’t think of anything except having
fun,” the director advised them. “Ted,
you help your sister and your brother on the
pony’s back, and then scramble up yourself.
Janet, you guide the pony as I call to you
through my megaphone. But, above all,
don’t look directly into the camera. We
want this to seem natural.”</p>

<p>“You can’t keep Trouble from looking at
the camera,” laughed Ted. “He’s doing it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
now. I guess he thinks music will come
out.”</p>

<p>“Well, it doesn’t matter so much about
him,” replied the director. “But you two
older ones keep your eyes away from the
camera. Look anywhere but there.”</p>

<p>There was a rehearsal first and finally the
director said the children did very well.</p>

<p>“All right now, we’ll try it in earnest,”
he said. “Come on—camera!”</p>

<p>Ted led his brother and sister through the
pasture toward the pony, which was a tame
one and fond of children. The Curlytops
had made friends with him the first day they
arrived.</p>

<p>“All right now,” called the director
through his megaphone, while the cameras
clicked away. “Put your sister up on the
pony’s back, Ted.”</p>

<p>This was done, and then the delighted and
shouting Trouble was helped up by Ted to
a seat behind Janet.</p>

<p>“Now you get on, and try to make the
pony run!” the director suggested.</p>

<p>Ted managed to scramble up on the back
of the little horse, and he did it very well.
But the pony this time seemed to dislike so
many on his back. Instead of running as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
was wanted to, the pony kicked up his heels,
and the next thing Ted knew he was falling
off.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re spoiling the picture! You
have spoiled it!” cried Janet, as she glanced
back, a funny look on her face, and saw her
brother slipping off.</p>

<p>But the cameras clicked away.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>JAN IN A TRAP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted Martin</span> hit the ground with a hard
thump. He grunted, for the breath was
knocked out of him. But he wasn’t hurt.
He knew that as soon as any one. At school
Ted played football sometimes, and more
than once he had had a harder fall than this.</p>

<p>“Whoa! Whoa!” cried Janet to the pony.
She pulled on the reins and the little animal
came to a stop.</p>

<p>“What’s matter?” Trouble wanted to
know. “Why don’t horse go on?”</p>

<p>“Because Ted’s fallen off,” explained his
sister.</p>

<p>By this time the Curlytop lad had leaped
up and was running to get on the pony.
What bothered him more than anything else
was the fact that the camera men, laughing
among themselves, were still grinding away
at the cranks of their machines, taking moving
pictures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“Wait! Wait!” cried Ted. “Don’t take
me now! Wait until I get on the pony!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Ted!” laughed Mr.
Birch. “This is funnier and better than I
thought it would be. Can you fall off
again?” he asked, as the camera men stopped
grinding, for Ted was now beside the pony
which had come to a halt, with Janet and
Trouble still on its back. “Can you fall
off again, Ted?”</p>

<p>“Can I fall off again?” cried the boy, in
surprise. “Do you mean you want me to
fall off on purpose?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I want,” replied Mr.
Birch. “The cameras happened to snap you
when you fell the first time. It made a good
scene, and I’m going to change the story
about to fit it in. But if you can do the same
thing again, maybe in a little different way,
it will be very funny. Want to try?”</p>

<p>“Sure I do!” declared Ted. “I’ll be just
like one of the funny men in the pictures,
won’t I?”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder,” agreed Mr. Birch,
with a laugh. “Now get ready,” he went
on. “Janet, you guide the pony along and
Ted will run up and try to get on. When
he does you make the pony go a little faster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
as if you were trying to get away. Then Ted
will slip to the ground as he did before. You
aren’t afraid, are you, little man?” he asked
Trouble.</p>

<p>“No, I not ’fraid,” was the answer. “I
like horsies an’ I like nellifunts. Once I
roded on a nellifunt, I did.”</p>

<p>“Good! Then a pony oughtn’t to frighten
you,” chuckled Mr. Birch. “Get ready
now!”</p>

<p>Again the pony ambled forward, with
Janet and Trouble on its back, and Ted ran
forward to get on. Janet did just as the
director told her to, and her brother slipped
off in a funny fashion.</p>

<p>“That’s fine!” cried Mr. Birch, with a
laugh. “You children will be in the movies
some day. It’s a good thing you fell off,
Ted, even if it was accidental at first, for it
gave me an idea. That’s the way it often
happens in this sort of work—accidents,
many times, make the best scenes.”</p>

<p>“I thought sure he’d spoiled the picture
when he slipped off,” confessed Janet, when
the cameras had stopped grinding.</p>

<p>“I did, too,” admitted Ted. “I’d like to
see how I looked when I fell.”</p>

<p>“We’ll let you do that some day,” promised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
the director. And I might say that,
later in the season when they were back
home, the Curlytops saw this picture, in
which they had had a part in making, shown
in the Cresco Theater. Ted beheld himself
running after the pony and slipping from
its back in a queer way that made him laugh.
All who saw it also laughed, including Ted’s
friends and playmates. As for Trouble,
when he saw himself and Janet on the pony,
the little fellow let out a scream of delight.</p>

<p>So, all in all, though at first it seemed as
though their efforts were going to fail, the
initial appearance of the Curlytops in the
movies was quite a success.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Martin liked it very much
at Dawson’s Farm, and only for the fact that
he had planned to make a tour induced the
father of the Curlytops to carry out the idea.</p>

<p>“It would be nice to stay here all summer,”
he said to his wife.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she agreed. “But I would like a
little change, and so would the children. I
want to get near a lake or a large river for
a week or two.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’d like that myself,” said Mr. Martin.
“And if I can manage it we may take
a motor boat trip. We’ll stay here until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
Mr. Portnay sends back that box of albums,
and then we’ll travel on.”</p>

<p>“You ought to hear from him in a day or
so,” said Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“I expect to,” replied her husband.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Curlytops and Trouble
were having a great deal of fun on the farm.
They were allowed to gather eggs and do
some of the small chores about the place,
such as feeding the chickens and taking salt
to some sheep in a distant pasture.</p>

<p>Every day some moving pictures were
taken, and when this happened not too far
away the children were allowed to watch.
Some of the scenes were filmed several miles
distant from the farm, in rocky glens or in
bits of woodland which were needed for the
background. On such occasions the actors
and actresses were piled into automobiles,
or those who had horses rode them, and the
whole company, cameras and all, would go
to the spot picked out by Mr. Birch.</p>

<p>Once he filmed a fishing scene, and when
Mr. Tizzy happened to mention the trick he
had played on Ted, the director had a great
idea.</p>

<p>“We’ll do that for the movies!” he cried.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
“It will be great. Will you children go
through with it for us?”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” said Ted, “if my father
thinks it’s all right.”</p>

<p>Mr. Martin gave his consent, and so, for
the second time, the Curlytops faced the
camera. Or, rather, they didn’t exactly face
it, for if you will notice in moving pictures,
the players hardly ever gaze directly at you,
which means that they don’t peer straight
at the lens of the camera.</p>

<p>But Ted threw in his baited hook and
waited for a bite, while the flip-flop man,
hidden in the grass around the bend in the
bank, fastened on a rubber boot. Another
camera took close-up views of this scene,
while the first camera was picturing Ted’s
surprise when he pulled up the rubber boot
full of water which spurted from the hole in
the toe.</p>

<p>The rest of the funny scene, with the shoe
and the tin can, was also taken, and Trouble
was even filmed catching a real fish, much to
his delight. Then Mr. Tizzy did flip-flops
while the children were shown laughing at
him after they had discovered the trick.
But the funny man did not again fall down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
the hole, as that was considered too dangerous.</p>

<p>The next day Mr. Martin received a letter
from the movie actor in New York, saying
how sorry Mr. Portnay was to learn that his
helper had, by mistake, picked up the box
of albums.</p>

<p>“I am having your box shipped back to
you by express,” wrote the leading man. “I
hope you will receive it safely. I may see
you before the summer is over, as my company
is going to travel in the same direction
you are taking on your tour.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope we do see him again!” exclaimed
Janet, when the letter was talked
about one afternoon. “I like him.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” declared Ted. “I wish I
could ride a horse as he does, or like Mr.
Weldon.”</p>

<p>“Well, I shall be glad to get back Mr.
Cardwell’s albums,” said Mr. Martin. “As
soon as that box comes we’ll travel on again
and bid good-by to the movie folk, at least
for a while.”</p>

<p>It was some time later, that same afternoon,
that Janet wandered off by herself to
a little wood lot about a mile from the farmhouse.
She wanted to pick some wild flowers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
and Ted, whom she asked to come with
her, said he didn’t want to.</p>

<p>But Janet did not mind going alone, for
she had often been in these same woods before.
She had been taking care of Trouble
nearly all of that day, and Trouble certainly
lived up to his name—he was full of mischief.
Jan was glad to get away from him
for a time, dearly as she loved him.</p>

<p>So she wandered about, picking flowers
that grew in the woods and enjoying the
beautiful scenes all about her. She neared
a little gully, down the sides of which grew
some blossoms she had not before noticed—beautiful
red flowers.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m going to get some of them!” she
murmured.</p>

<p>Down the pine-needle-covered sides of the
gully she scrambled, toward a big clump of
ferns, near which grew the red flowers she
so much admired.</p>

<p>The sides of the gully were steeper than
Janet realized, and she was going faster
than she thought—so fast, in fact, that
when she reached the clump of ferns she
couldn’t stop. Right through them she had
to run, and, before she knew it, she saw that
just behind them, hidden in a growth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
tangled bushes, was what seemed to be a
large box.</p>

<p>It was a box one end of which was open.
Before Janet had time to wonder what such
a big box was doing out there in the woods,
and before she could stop herself, she had
run right into it, through the opening.</p>

<p>“I wonder what this is?” thought the
little girl. “It has such a funny smell—like
wild animals in the circus!”</p>

<p>There was a clicking sound and the big
box, which Janet was now inside of, began
to tremble. Then came a jar and a thud,
and it suddenly grew dark.</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Janet.</p>

<p>She whirled about, but too late!</p>

<p>Behind her, the opening was closed. The
sliding end of the box trap—for such it was—had
dropped into place, falling shut, and
making poor Janet a prisoner.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m in a trap!” she cried. “In a
wild animal trap! How am I ever going to
get out?”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>THE BOX COMES BACK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Janet Martin</span> was frightened—very
much so, though not so much but what she
kept her wits about her and looked around
the strange prison in which she found herself.</p>

<p>At first, when the sliding door in the end
of the box trap had fallen, closing the only
way out, it had been very dark. But in a
few moments Jan was able to look about her,
and she noticed that near the top of the box
there were openings which let in light and
air. The openings were merely holes, not
large enough for a cat or dog to get through,
to say nothing of a girl like Janet.</p>

<p>The box was about six feet wide, almost
as long, and quite as high, so there was
plenty of room for Janet to stand up in it
and walk about.</p>

<p>“It would make a nice play-house,” she
thought to herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>But she did not feel at all like playing
now. All she wanted to do was to get out
of this box trap prison. So well had it been
concealed in the bushes back of the clump of
ferns that Jan had not noticed it at all until
she had entered.</p>

<p>“I guess a wild animal would do the same
thing,” thought Janet. “He’d run right in
here and be caught. I must have jiggled
something that made the door slide down.
And I guess there’s been a wild animal in
here not long ago. It smells so.”</p>

<p>On the floor of the trap were dried leaves
and grass; and the whole place smelled like
the inside of the animal tent at a circus, a
queer, wild smell which most of you know,
I am sure.</p>

<p>“But if there was a wild animal in here,
how did he get out?” thought the little girl,
who, now that her eyes were accustomed to
the semi-darkness, could see about her quite
plainly. “If he got out, maybe I can.”</p>

<p>She pushed against the sides of the box
as hard as she could and she pounded with
her little fists, but the box seemed very solid.
Then she tried to raise the sliding door that
had dropped shut behind her as soon as she
entered the trap. But though this door rattled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
and moved a little in the grooves in
which it slid up and down, Jan could not
raise it. It seemed to be fastened in place.</p>

<p>“Maybe the wild animal that was caught
here didn’t get out,” thought the little
Curlytop girl. “Maybe Mr. Dawson had
to come and let it out; or maybe some of the
movie people. I guess that was it—they
caught a moving picture animal in this trap,
and now they’ve caught me and I can’t get
out!”</p>

<p>Janet cried a little as she thought of this.
It would soon be dark, she feared, and she
did not want to stay in the trap all night.</p>

<p>“I know what I’ll do,” thought Janet, as
she dried her tears, for she knew crying did
no good. “I’ll yell as loud as I can. I’ll
call and shout and somebody will hear me
and come and let me out. Maybe Ted will
come, or that funny flip-flop man.”</p>

<p>Having thus made up her mind, Janet
began to shout and call. Her voice sounded
strange and hollow in the box trap. She
wondered how far it would carry. She
hoped they might hear her down at the
farmhouse, but she hardly thought this possible.</p>

<p>Then a new terror came to poor Janet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
She began to think of the wild animal that
had been in the trap.</p>

<p>“Maybe it was a bear,” she whispered to
herself. “And maybe he might hear me yelling
and come to see me. I wouldn’t like
that. But, anyhow, he couldn’t get in, since
I can’t get out.”</p>

<p>For the first time Janet was glad the trap
was firmly closed. True, she couldn’t get
out, but then, no wild animal could get in.</p>

<p>After Janet had called as loudly as she
could for some time and no one had answered,
she began to feel tired. So she sat
down in a corner of the box trap, on the soft
dried grass and leaves.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! I wish some one would come
and get me out!” she sighed.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Mrs. Martin
began to inquire for Janet. The little girl
had told her mother about going to the
“wood lot,” as Mr. Dawson called it, to pick
flowers.</p>

<p>“But it’s time she was back,” Mrs. Martin
said to her husband. “It will soon be evening.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go after her!” offered Ted, who had
just come back from a distant pasture, having
been there with one of the hired men to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
salt the sheep. Every so often lumps of
coarse, rock salt were put in boxes in the
fields where the sheep roamed. Sheep, and
most other animals, like a bit of salt now
and then. It keeps them healthy.</p>

<p>“All right, Teddy,” said his mother. “I
wish you would go after Janet. She’s probably
all right, but she has forgotten it is
getting late. Very likely she has found
more flowers than she expected and she
wants to get a big bouquet.”</p>

<p>“I come, too!” offered Trouble, as he saw
his brother starting away.</p>

<p>“No, you stay here,” objected Mrs. Martin,
with a laugh. “We don’t want you getting
lost.”</p>

<p>“I’ll soon be back,” Ted called to William.</p>

<p>The Curlytop lad well knew the path to
the wood lot, for he and his sister had trod
it many times since coming to Dawson’s
Farm. And now running and now walking
fast, Ted was soon on the edge of the clump
of trees. He looked about, but did not see
any signs of his sister.</p>

<p>“Maybe she started back another way,”
he told himself.</p>

<p>But he decided to give a good look around
in the woods, and when he had done so and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
had not yet caught a glimpse of Janet picking
flowers, Ted began to feel worried.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll give a yell and see if she answers,”
he said to himself. So he called:
“Janet! Janet! Oh, Jan! where are you?”</p>

<p>Ted paused for a reply, but none came.</p>

<p>Then he called again, and listened. About
him he heard only the rustle of the wind in
the trees, the whisperings of the bushes, the
tinkle of a distant waterfall and the songs
of birds.</p>

<p>“I wonder where she is?” thought the boy.</p>

<p>Taking a long breath, he gave the loudest
shout of which he was capable. It made him
red in the face. Then he listened.</p>

<p>At last he heard an answer.</p>

<p>“Ted! Oh, Ted! Come and get me out!
I’m in a trap!”</p>

<p>It was Janet’s voice, beyond a doubt, but
such a strange voice—and faint and far
away. Ted remembered once when his sister
had been shut in the preserve closet down
the cellar at home in Cresco. Her voice
then had sounded just as it did now.</p>

<p>“But there isn’t any cellar here,” thought
Ted. Once more he called: “Where are
you? I can’t see you!”</p>

<p>“I’m shut up in a box trap!” answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
Janet. “It’s by a big clump of ferns down
in a little hollow.”</p>

<p>Ted at that moment was standing on the
edge of the gully into which Janet had run
to get the red flowers. And, looking down,
Ted saw where the ferns had been broken
and bent to one side as his sister pushed
through them. He also saw the top of the
box hidden among the bushes.</p>

<p>“All right! I’m coming, Jan!” cried
Ted, as he scrambled down the steep sides.</p>

<p>Janet had been roused from a half slumber
by the call of her brother’s voice and
had answered him. Thus he had found her.</p>

<p>But when he stood in front of the box
trap, Ted was a bit puzzled as to how Janet
had gotten in and how he was going to get
her out.</p>

<p>“How does this thing work?” he called to
his sister, through the wooden sides.
“How’d you get in?”</p>

<p>“I ran in when the door was open. I ran
in before I knew what it was,” answered
Janet. “Then the door dropped shut. I
guess I must have jiggled something.”</p>

<p>“I guess you did,” answered Ted. “Now
I wonder if I can get this door open! I’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
got to pry it up with a long stick if I can
find one.”</p>

<p>Luckily, the Curlytop lad discovered just
what was needed—a long tree branch, sharp
on one end, like a wedge. This wedge he put
under the edge of the sliding door and pried
it up. As the door raised a little, Ted,
holding it in that position with one hand on
the long stick, while Janet helped from the
inside, thrust a stone beneath the door.
There was a crack wide enough for Janet
to thrust out her hand.</p>

<p>“But I can’t crawl out through that
crack,” she said.</p>

<p>“I know it,” answered her brother. “I’ll
lift it up higher.”</p>

<p>This he did, a foot or so at a time, putting
more stones and finally upright sticks beneath
the wooden slide, until it was raised
high enough for Janet to crawl out.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad you came!” she cried to
her brother.</p>

<p>“So’m I,” he said. “But what made you
go in there?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it was a trap,” explained
the little girl. “I saw some red flowers and
I ran to pick them and before I knew it
I was in the box, and I must have jiggled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
something for the door fell shut behind me
and I couldn’t get out.”</p>

<p>“I guess it’s a wild animal trap, all right,”
Ted remarked. “It smells so,” and he
sniffed the air.</p>

<p>“Do you think they catch bears here?”
asked Janet.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” assented Ted.</p>

<p>“Then let’s run home,” suggested his sister,
for it was now getting dusk in the woods,
though it was lighter out in the open.</p>

<p>Ted took out the sticks and stones from
beneath the door, letting it drop into place
again.</p>

<p>“So nobody else will be caught,” he explained.</p>

<p>Then he and his sister hurried back to the
farmhouse.</p>

<p>“Say, now, that’s too bad!” exclaimed
Mr. Birch, the movie director, when he
heard what had happened. “We did have
some wild animals in that box, but they were
foxes, not bears. And we didn’t trap the
foxes—we just held them in that box so we
could let them run out when we wanted to
take moving pictures of them.</p>

<p>“We hid the box in the bushes so it
wouldn’t show in the picture, and the door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
was pulled up by a long rope. After we
filmed the foxes some of the men must have
left the door open, taking off the ropes. So
it was turned into a regular trap, though we
didn’t intend it as such.</p>

<p>“The door thus left propped up, when
Janet went in she must have ‘jiggled’ it, as
she says, so it dropped into place. I’m
mighty sorry about it, little girl!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind, as long as I got out
before dark,” laughed Jan. “But I was
scared for a little while.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see that it doesn’t happen again,”
declared the director. “We have no further
use for the box, since we have made the
fox films, so I’ll have it taken away.”</p>

<p>A few days later most of the pictures intended
to be filmed at Dawson’s Farm had
been taken, and the company prepared to
move on to the next location. Already some
of the cowboys and other men and women
connected with the company had left.</p>

<p>One last scene taken was where Mr.
Tizzy, the funny flip-flop man, pretended to
be a cowboy, riding a horse to lasso a pig.
It was a lively affair. The animal used was
not the savage boar that had nearly hurt
Trouble, but a more gentle pig.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>The Curlytops and their father and
mother, as well as the Dawson household,
laughed until the tears ran out of their eyes
at the funny antics of Mr. Tizzy and the no
less funny actions of the pig.</p>

<p>At last the flip-flop man lassoed the squealing
pig, which, however, dragged the man off
his horse and pulled him around the lot.
And of all this the clicking cameras took
many pictures which, later, made thousands
of persons laugh.</p>

<p>It was this same afternoon that an express
package came for Mr. Martin. It was
a wooden box well wrapped in paper.</p>

<p>“What is it, Daddy? Oh, what is it?”
cried Janet, dancing up and down in excitement.</p>

<p>“Oh, let him look first, Jan,” admonished
Teddy.</p>

<p>“Ah, the album box has come back!” said
the father of the Curlytops. “Now I won’t
have to tell Mr. Cardwell it is missing. We
can take it on the tour with us.”</p>

<p>He tore open one end of the paper wrapping,
disclosing the red, shining wooden box.</p>

<p>“No need to take off all the paper,” he
said. “It is well packed and I’ll leave it so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
and put it in the car. We’ll travel on again
to-morrow, Curlytops!”</p>

<p>Ted and Janet were glad of this, though
they liked it at the farm. But children are
always glad of a change, I suppose.</p>

<p>So Mr. Martin put the wrapped box in his
car. If he had only taken off all the paper
and had looked more closely inside, there
would have been a different ending to this
story.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>ON AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Mrs. Martin called Janet the next
morning, to tell the Curlytop girl to get up,
dress and have breakfast, ready to start
touring again, Janet, with her eyes still
closed, began to call:</p>

<p>“Let me out! Let me out! Oh, don’t let
the bears come in!”</p>

<p>This awakened Trouble, and he wanted to
know what the matter was.</p>

<p>“I guess Janet thinks she is back in the
box trap again,” said Mrs. Martin, with a
smile. “Wake up, my dear! Wake up,”
she went on, giving her daughter a gentle
shake. “You’re all right, Janet.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” gasped the little girl, as she
opened her eyes. She was plainly surprised
to find herself safe in bed in the room with
her mother and Trouble. “I—I thought I
was in the box trap and a bear was trying to
come in with me,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>“I thought that was it,” replied her
mother. “It was quite an adventure for
you, but don’t think any more about it.”</p>

<p>And Janet tried not to.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to see you folks go,” Mr. Dawson
said to Mr. Martin, when the Curlytop
family was at breakfast. “The old farm
will be a lonesome place with you and the
movie people leaving. The last of them will
go to-day, too.”</p>

<p>“We have enjoyed it here,” said Mrs.
Martin.</p>

<p>“We’ll come back again,” promised
Trouble, as he finished the last of his boiled
egg and drank the glass of milk. “I like
it here a lot.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you do, my dear,” said motherly
Mrs. Dawson.</p>

<p>The big touring car was brought around
to the side porch, and into it the Martin family
baggage was piled. Mr. Martin made
sure that the box Mr. Portnay had sent
from New York was in a safe place.</p>

<p>“I hope nothing more happens to that box
before I deliver it to Mr. Cardwell in Bentville,”
said Ted’s father, with a sigh of relief
as he put the small chest under some
robes. “If I had known all the anxiety it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
was going to give us, I’d never have promised
to deliver it for my neighbor,” he told
Mr. Dawson.</p>

<p>“Well, when you have a lot of worry it’s
best to get it over with,” said the farmer.
“Be sure and stop off to see us when you
come this way again.”</p>

<p>“We will,” promised Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>Then the Curlytops were off again on their
summer touring trip. More adventures lay
ahead of them.</p>

<p>“Where are we going now, Daddy?”
asked Janet, as they rode along a pleasant
country highway.</p>

<p>“The next big place at which we expect to
stop is called Evenham,” was the answer.
“But we won’t be there before to-morrow or
next day.”</p>

<p>“Where do you expect to stop to-night?”
asked Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“What would you say to camping out?”
her husband wanted to know.</p>

<p>“In the tent?” cried Ted.</p>

<p>“Oh, what fun!” echoed Jan.</p>

<p>“I goin’ to make a campfire!” declared
Trouble.</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that,” his father answered.
“Yes, if your mother thinks well of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
it, we can stop in some good place, rig the
tent up to the side of the car, and stay there
all night,” Mr. Martin went on to Ted and
Janet. “It’s going to be a warm, pleasant
night.”</p>

<p>“And can we cook a meal?” Ted wanted
to know. “It isn’t like camping out if you
don’t cook your own meal.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we can do that, too,” said Mrs.
Martin, who liked camp life and roughing it
almost as much as did the Curlytops.</p>

<p>So it was decided, and in the next town
they stopped to purchase some bacon, coffee
and other things they could cook over their
alcohol stoves. They carried two small
stoves.</p>

<p>About noon the auto was rolling along a
quiet country road, and, finding a lane which
did not seem to be much traveled, Mr. Martin
turned off on that to be out of the way
of traffic while lunch was being got ready.</p>

<p>Then such a good time as the Curlytops
had, and Trouble also!</p>

<p>For they prepared a meal out in the open,
and the table that was set was the running-board
of the car, papers being spread on it
for a cloth.</p>

<p>“Oh, I just love it here! Don’t you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
Ted?” murmured Janet, her mouth half
filled with part of a peanut butter sandwich.</p>

<p>“It’s dandy!” Ted exclaimed, as he
reached for another slice of bacon, for Mrs.
Martin had fried some in a little pan over
the stove which burned solid chunks of alcohol.
And such a wonderful odor as that
bacon gave off in the woods! It was worth
going miles just to get a whiff of it.</p>

<p>After the meal Mr. and Mrs. Martin
strolled about in the woods while the children
played near by. The radiator of the
car was filled with fresh water from a clear,
bubbling spring, and then the touring party
started on again.</p>

<p>“We must be looking for a good place to
make our night camp,” Mrs. Martin said,
later in the afternoon. “We don’t have to
go on to any certain place, so if we find a
good spot we might as well stop there and
begin to put up the tent. We want to get
everything in readiness before dark.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed her husband. “So
keep your eyes open, children.”</p>

<p>Ted and Janet did, with the result that
they pointed out several more or less good
spots for a night camp. There were objections
to most of these, however. But at last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
Mrs. Martin spied what seemed to all of
them to be a delightful place. It was in a
meadow, on the edge of a clump of woods,
and there was a spring of water near by.
It is always wise to camp near water.</p>

<p>“This seems all right,” agreed Mr. Martin,
as he drove the auto into the glade.
“And there aren’t any neighbors.”</p>

<p>He spoke truly, for there was not a house
in sight. It was a beautiful spot, very quiet
and restful.</p>

<p>“Not even a cow,” said Janet.</p>

<p>Ted helped his father get the portable tent
out and attach it to the sides of the car while
Mrs. Martin prepared the evening meal.
There were folding cots which, when spread
out, made comfortable little beds.</p>

<p>It was arranged that Trouble and Janet
would sleep on the seats of the auto, with
the side curtains put up so they would be
snug and comfortable. And on cots, under
the extended tent, Ted, his mother and his
father would pass the night.</p>

<p>Supper was eaten with keen appetites,
and then the Martin family sat about in the
beautiful evening glow, singing songs and
telling stories. They saw no signs of life,
no near-by farmers happened along, and not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
so much as one car passed up or down the
road.</p>

<p>The frogs in a distant pond began to croak
as night fell, and pretty soon Mrs. Martin
noticed that Trouble’s eyes were closing.</p>

<p>“Bedtime!” she announced, and though
Ted and Janet declared they weren’t a bit
sleepy, their parents said they had better
“turn in.”</p>

<p>“We’ll get an early start in the morning,”
said Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>Trouble was asleep almost as soon as he
had been tucked in on the comfortable auto
seat, and Janet was not far behind him in
journeying to slumberland.</p>

<p>But to Ted, out in the tent with his father
and his mother, sleep did not come so
quickly. The little boy pretended he was a
cowboy, sleeping out on the plains, with a
big herd of cattle near by.</p>

<p>Perhaps his lively thoughts kept Ted
awake. At any rate, something did; but at
last he, too, closed his eyes and was soon
fast asleep.</p>

<p>Just how long it was afterward he did not
know. But he was suddenly awakened by
feeling something touch him on the side. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
was as though some one had “punched him
in the ribs,” Ted said afterward.</p>

<p>The little fellow opened his eyes and murmured:</p>

<p>“Is it morning, Mother?”</p>

<p>He imagined it was his mother rousing
him by shaking him, as she sometimes did.</p>

<p>His mother did not answer. Then Teddy
saw that the tent was dark. The sun was not
streaming in. But through a crack the lad
caught sight of a distant star. He knew it
was still night.</p>

<p>But something had awakened him by
touching him on the side. He raised himself
on his elbow and listened. He could
tell, by the deep, regular breathing of his
father and mother that they were sleeping
soundly on their cots.</p>

<p>Then from the outside of the tent something
reached in and gave Teddy such a blow
that he was knocked back on his cot.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>ALONG THE RIVER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment or two the Curlytop lad
was so surprised, as well as a little frightened,
that he lay quietly, not moving nor
saying a word. Then he knew he must do
something about it. Never would it do to
let some strange man, as Ted supposed this
to be, come into the tent and take Mr. Martin’s
money, or perhaps the box of valuable
photograph albums.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s kidnapers after William!”
was one of the wild thoughts that flashed
into the mind of the lad. He was glad then
that William was sleeping in the auto with
Janet.</p>

<p>But in a moment or two Ted recovered the
breath that had been knocked out of him by
the blow that had sent him back on his cot,
and he raised himself again. He could see
more plainly now, for the side of the tent
near his cot had become unfastened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>Whatever or whoever it was that had
thrust Teddy back had loosened some of the
tent fastenings, and through this opening
the little boy could see the stars more plainly
now.</p>

<p>Teddy could also see something else.
This was a large object, with a mouth, a big
nose, and great eyes, and, what was worse
than this, Teddy caught sight of two spreading
horns.</p>

<p>Then it was that the Curlytop lad let out
a yell that awakened every one in the temporary
camp—awakened even Trouble and
Janet who were sleeping very soundly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Daddy! Mother!” yelled Teddy.
“There’s a big animal with horns coming
into the tent. Look!”</p>

<p>The head of the beast was now well within
the tent, and it leaned right over Ted’s cot.
But you can be sure the little lad was not
there. No, indeed! He had rolled off on
the other side, falling to the grassy ground.</p>

<p>But his frightened shout had awakened
his father and mother, and the first thing
Mr. Martin did was to thrust his hand beneath
his pillow and get his flashlight. This
little electric torch Mr. Martin always kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
near him at night, and it was useful in more
ways than one.</p>

<p>Snapping on the switch now, he threw a
small but brilliant beam of light over toward
Ted’s cot. At first he could not see the boy,
and wondering what the noise was all about
Mr. Martin asked:</p>

<p>“Where are you, Ted?”</p>

<p>“Here I am,” came the answer, and
Janet’s brother arose from the ground
where he had thrown himself.</p>

<p>“What in the world are you doing there?”
asked his mother, who was sitting up on her
cot. “Did you have nightmare? Were you
walking in your sleep?”</p>

<p>“No, I wasn’t walking in my sleep,” replied
Teddy. “But I gave a jump and I
fell out of bed.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked his father, for he saw
nothing to be alarmed about. And the reason
was that the horned head had withdrawn
itself out of the hole through which it had
been thrust.</p>

<p>“What for? That’s what for! Look!”
cried Teddy, and he pointed just as the big
head was thrust in again—the head with the
large mouth and the big eyes, to say nothing
of the horns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>Mrs. Martin stared as if she could hardly
believe what she saw. She gave a gasp of
surprise. Teddy, too, gasped, but no longer
in fright. For now he saw what it was that
had thrust its head into the tent.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin laughed, and well he might.
For in the gleam of the electric flashlight
they were looking at the calm features of a
big cow that, with her head thrust into the
tent, was quietly chewing her cud, leaning
over the cot from which Ted had leaped in
such a hurry.</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” cried Janet, who looked over
the side of the auto into the tent to which it
was attached. Then Trouble looked and he
cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, a cow! A cow! Is it morning an’
did the cow come to bring us milk?”</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly; though it looks that
way,” said Mr. Martin, with another laugh.
“Was it this cow that frightened you,
Teddy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I—I guess so,” replied the lad.
“I felt something poke me in the ribs, and
I woke up, and then the tent side sort of
flew open and this big head came poking in
and I didn’t know what it was, so I rolled
off my cot on the other side.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>“Which was a wise thing to do, seeing that
you couldn’t very well tell in the dark what
was after you,” said his mother.</p>

<p>“It might have been a bear,” said Janet.
“I’m glad it wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” added Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“Would a bear eat peanuts like a nellifunt?”
Trouble wanted to know.</p>

<p>“I guess a bear will eat almost anything,”
said Mr. Martin, as he slipped on his shoes.
“I think I’d better go out and tie this wandering
cow to a tree,” he said. “Or else
she’ll be back just as soon as we get to
sleep, bothering us again. For that’s what
she is—a wandering cow. She was probably
tethered out for the night and broke
loose. She must have come to pay us a
visit.”</p>

<p>“Well, some fresh milk for the morning
coffee would be very welcome,” remarked
Mrs. Martin. “But I’m not going to milk
a cow in the middle of the night. Fasten her
well, Dick, so she won’t get loose again.”</p>

<p>“I will,” answered Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>The cow was very gentle and tame. She
probably did not intend to frighten Teddy
by thrusting her horns against the tent, poking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
him in the ribs and afterward thrusting
her head inside. It was all an accident.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin found a rope that was
fastened around the animal’s neck, and soon
led her well away from the camp, tying her
to a tree. Then he came back to the little
tent and soon the place was quiet again, and
all the Martins slept soundly until morning.</p>

<p>Getting breakfast was lots of fun, and
they had fresh milk, after all. For while
Mrs. Martin was making coffee a farm boy
came strolling along, looking for the lost
cow. When he heard what had happened
and saw the creature tied to a tree, he milked
her, Mrs. Martin giving him a pail for this
purpose.</p>

<p>“It’s only fair to give you some milk after
the fright the cow gave you,” said the farm
lad, with a grin. “Where you folks going?”
he asked, as he looked with eager eyes at
the auto and the tent fastened to it.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re just touring around,” Teddy
answered. “I guess we’ll go up the river
to-day.”</p>

<p>He had heard his father say they might
do that, for they were near a large stream
alongside of which wound a good road leading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
into a pleasant country with great
stretches of woodland.</p>

<p>After breakfast, at which Trouble drank
with glee some milk from the “night cow,”
as he called her, preparations were made for
a trip up the river.</p>

<p>The tent was taken down and folded into
a small space, as were the folding cots.
Then, once more, the Curlytops were on their
way. They soon reached the river road, and
Mr. Martin was glad to find it in good condition.</p>

<p>“This will take us many miles on our
way,” he said.</p>

<p>All that morning they traveled, stopping
at noon in a little glade of trees to cook and
eat lunch. They were ready to go on again
when Mr. Martin discovered that one of the
tires was flat.</p>

<p>“There’s a leak in that inner tube,” he
told his wife. “I might as well stop and
mend it now and save our spare tire and
tube. We might need to make a change in
more of a hurry. I have plenty of time now,
so I’ll stop and mend that leaky inner tube.”</p>

<p>This suited Ted, Janet and Trouble, who
were having fun in the woods and along the
bank of the river which ran near by. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
Martin jacked up the car, took off the rim
and tire, and, taking the thin, rubber inner
tube from the shoe, proceeded to fasten on
a patch.</p>

<p>He finished this work, and then, to make
sure the leak was mended, he took the foot
pump and filled the red, inner tube with air
as it lay on the ground.</p>

<p>The tube was well pumped up and Mr.
Martin was waiting to see if any of the air
leaked out when a cry from the children on
the bank of the river attracted the attention
of father and mother. They looked up and
saw Trouble and the Curlytops standing
there and pointing to a small raft of logs
that was slowly floating down the stream.</p>

<p>At one end of the raft was a little cabin,
made of slabs of wood with the bark side out,
and from this cabin, or shanty, was coming
a curl of smoke, showing that this was where
the lumbermen slept and cooked.</p>

<p>There was a dog on the raft, and when he
saw the children he barked joyfully and
wagged his tail. Then, unexpectedly, as the
rear of the raft swung in close to shore, the
dog leaped off and a moment later was frolicking
with the Curlytops.</p>

<p>The “lumber dog,” as Trouble called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
him, seemed to be wild with joy at being
once again on land and near children. He
ran up and down, barking in delight and
wagging his tail until it seemed it would
come off.</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, the dog ran toward
the blown-up inner tube which lay on the
ground while Mr. Martin waited to see if it
leaked any more.</p>

<p>The dog gave one look at what, to him,
must have been a strange object, and then
he growled and barked at it.</p>

<p>“Look out! Don’t touch that!” cried
Mr. Martin, with a laugh.</p>

<p>He was too late, however, for the dog
sprang forward and caught the tire tube in
his mouth. He gripped it savagely, as a dog
will do with something he fears, and a moment
later there came a loud noise, as if a
gun had been fired.</p>

<p>Heels over head that dog went toppling
back, howling in dismay.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>TWO BEARS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> of the lumbermen in charge of
the raft of logs came rushing out of the slab
cabin at the sound of the shot—or what they
thought was a shot from a gun.</p>

<p>One of the men, seeing the dog, rushed
to the edge of the raft and cried:</p>

<p>“Who shot Spot?”</p>

<p>“Nobody shot him!” laughed the steersman,
who was chuckling so with mirth that
he let go of the long sweep that was used to
guide the raft. “Leastways, if he’s shot he
shot himself! Ho! Ho!”</p>

<p>“Shot himself! What do you mean?”
asked one of the lumbermen.</p>

<p>The Curlytops, also, did not understand
what had happened. But Mr. Martin, looking
at the inner tube of his tire which was
now quite flat, knew what had taken place.</p>

<p>“Yep, Spot shot himself!” laughed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
steersman. “He bit into that blown-up auto
tire on the shore and made a hole in it. He
punctured it, and the air popped out like a
gun, right in his face. I guess Spot thought
he was shot, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“It did sound like a gun,” remarked one
of the men. “Hi, Spot!” he called.</p>

<p>With a bark, the dog, his tail between
his legs in fright, raced along the shore
and gave a leap which carried him across the
water between the raft and the bank and
landed him on the logs. Then he ran inside
the cabin and hid himself.</p>

<p>The steersman guided the log raft against
the bank, thus bringing it to a stop, and he
jumped ashore.</p>

<p>“I’m right sorry, sir, that our dog punctured
your tire,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” replied Mr. Martin,
with a smile. “It’s easily mended
again. We aren’t fussy about dogs—we
have one at home.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” murmured the lumberman.
“Some folks don’t like dogs, but
they’re a heap of company, I say. I reckon
Spot must have thought your auto tire was
a big, red bologna sausage, all ready for him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
to eat, and he wanted to take a bite out
of it.”</p>

<p>“He might have thought that,” said Mr.
Martin. “His sharp teeth didn’t take long
to put a hole in the tube. And it certainly
shot off like a gun.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t know much about auto tires—this
dog of ours,” said the steersman. “I
reckon he never saw a red blowed-up tire on
the ground before.”</p>

<p>“And he’ll never want to see another, I
reckon!” added a big lumberman in high
boots. “He sure was a scared dog.”</p>

<p>“Won’t he come out again and play with
us?” Trouble wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Maybe I can coax him out,” said one of
the men.</p>

<p>After some urging, Spot was induced to
leave the cabin, where he had been cowering
under a bunk. He whined and seemed still
afraid, but when the Curlytops had coaxed
him ashore and romped about with him, he
regained his spirits and began to bark and
leap about.</p>

<p>“Don’t put that tube on the ground again
after you get it mended,” said Mrs. Martin
to her husband, with a laugh, as she saw him
at work, cementing another patch on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
place where Spot’s sharp teeth had gone
through the rubber.</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” he agreed.</p>

<p>And when the tube had been mended again
Mr. Martin hung it over the rear of the car
to dry. It held the air when he tested it,
and, slipping it inside the shoe, he pumped
it up fully and soon had the rim and tire
back on the car.</p>

<p>By this time the raft had been worked out
from shore and was ready to go on again.</p>

<p>“Here, Spot!” called the steersman.</p>

<p>The dog seemed to want to remain on
shore and have fun with the Curlytops, but
he knew his master’s voice and, with a little
whine and bark of farewell, he jumped on
the moving raft and went on down the river.</p>

<p>“Good-by!” called Trouble, waving his
hand to the dog. And Spot waved his tail
in answer.</p>

<p>“Where did the raft come from?” asked
Ted, for he had seen his father talking to the
men while waiting for the second tire patch
to dry.</p>

<p>“The trees were cut in the woods, quite a
distance up the river,” explained Mr. Martin.
“They were floated down from the
lumber camp, a few miles up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“Could we go to the lumber camp?”
asked Ted. “I’d like to see it.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see it, too,” added Janet.
“We had fun in a lumber camp once.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t much going on in a lumber
camp in the summer time,” explained their
father. “Winter is the busy season there,
for the logs are cut and hauled through the
woods to the edge of the water that is to
float them to the mill.”</p>

<p>“How can the water float them to the mill
in winter when the rivers and lakes are
frozen?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“That’s just it—they don’t float the logs
down in the winter,” his father explained.
“They pile them up near the river and wait
for spring to come when the snow and ice
melts and makes the water very high—higher
than at any other time of the year.
It is on this high water that the logs are
floated down.</p>

<p>“However, there is some little work being
done in this lumber camp now, the men said.
They are cleaning up the logs left over from
the spring freshet run, and this raft was one
of that sort. I suppose we might stop off at
this lumber camp, if your mother thinks it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
would be all right,” said Mr. Martin, looking
at his wife.</p>

<p>“Do whatever you like,” she said, with a
smile. “We are touring around to give the
Curlytops a good time, and we might as well
stop at the lumber camp as anywhere else.”</p>

<p>So it was decided, and after making sure
nothing had been left behind, the auto party
went on again.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin expected to reach the lumber
camp that evening, and he knew he would be
welcome there with his family, to spend the
night, for the men on the raft had told him
so. They could sleep in one of the log
cabins, the steersman said, since only a few
of the wood-choppers were in the camp now.</p>

<p>But the river road, which had been very
good at first, soon became so rough that the
auto had to be driven slowly, and not as
good time could be made. Also the distance
was farther than Mr. Martin thought, or at
least farther than the men on the raft had
told him.</p>

<p>When the evening shadows began to fall
they were still traveling along, with no
signs of the lumber camp in sight.</p>

<p>“I guess we shall have to camp out again
to-night alongside the road,” remarked Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
Martin, as he scanned the highway ahead of
him and saw no sign of a house.</p>

<p>“That’ll be fun!” declared Ted.</p>

<p>“Maybe a horse will visit you to-night instead
of a cow,” his sister said.</p>

<p>“I don’t want either one,” declared the
lad.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin drove the auto on for another
mile or two and then, coming to a place he
thought would make a good camp—an open
space near a spring—he stopped and the
work of making camp for the night was
begun.</p>

<p>The tent was stretched out from the side
of the auto and the folding cots put beneath
the shelter. As before, Janet and Trouble
would sleep in the auto itself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin got the supper over the alcohol
stoves, which, though small, gave good
heat. Ted and Janet gathered wood, for
their father had said they might make a
campfire and sit about it before going to
bed.</p>

<p>When the meal was finished Ted was
allowed to light the fire. The children sat
about it on smooth stumps, pretending they
were early settlers living in the wilderness.</p>

<p>“It’s just like the Pilgrims,” said Janet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
who was fond of history. “Only there
aren’t any wild Indians or wild animals to
come after us,” she added.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the only difference,” agreed
Ted.</p>

<p>“They is some wild animals,” said
Trouble, who was sitting near his mother.
He suddenly arose and looked off toward
the forest. “They is some wild animals
here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, there aren’t, Trouble!” declared
Ted.</p>

<p>“Yes, they is!” insisted his little brother.
“They is two bears! I see them! Here
they come!”</p>

<p>He pointed across the open glade, and the
Curlytops, looking, saw, to their great astonishment,
two bears shuffling their way
toward them!</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh!” screamed Janet. “Oh, look
at the bears!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>THE LUMBER CAMP</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Martin</span>, who had been busy making
sure that everything about the camp was
snug and secure for the night, did not at
first glimpse the bears. But he heard what
Janet exclaimed and called to her:</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t pretend so hard if I were
you, Jan, especially about bears at night.
You might scare Trouble.”</p>

<p>“But, Daddy!” cried Janet, as she ran
toward him, “there <i>are</i> bears! <i>Real</i> ones!
And Trouble saw them first.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Mr. Martin,
emerging from behind the auto, where he
was making sure the tent flaps were fast.</p>

<p>“Yes, here are two bears, Dick!” said his
wife. “And they’re coming right for us!
We’d certainly better do something!”</p>

<p>“I’ll do something!” cried Ted, picking
up a blazing brand. “I’ll scare ’em with
this!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“No! No! You mustn’t!” objected his
mother.</p>

<p>“Bears are afraid of fire!” stated Ted.</p>

<p>“These don’t seem to be,” observed Janet.
“They’re coming right for us!”</p>

<p>She had turned, on her way to join her
father, and she saw the shaggy creatures
still shuffling along. By this time Mr. Martin
had reached the open place and he had
a sight of the bears.</p>

<p>“Bless my stars!” cried the father of the
Curlytops. “Who would have thought to
find bears here? But they must be tame
bears!”</p>

<p>“I certainly hope so!” exclaimed his wife.</p>

<p>“They must be!” said her husband again.
“Wild bears would run at the sight of us—not
come nearer. Some lumberman must
have caught these two when they were small,
and he’s tamed them. They aren’t much
more yet than two-year-old cubs. I believe
they’re coming to see if they can find something
to eat.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if they’re tame bears maybe they’ll
do tricks!” cried Ted.</p>

<p>“Maybe they’ll eat peanuts like nellifunts!”
added Trouble.</p>

<p>“Well, you aren’t going to feed these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
bears peanuts!” decided his mother, catching
the little fellow up in her arms and stepping
back toward the auto with him.</p>

<p>“Oh, look! They’re eating!” suddenly
cried Ted, pointing.</p>

<p>Surely enough, the two bears that had been
shuffling along in the peculiar way bears
have, had now come to a stop some little distance
away from the campfire and began
sniffing along the ground.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of them seemed to find some
dainty, for he picked it up. And an instant
later the other, with a sort of squealing
growl, tried to knock whatever it was from
the mouth of the first bear.</p>

<p>“They’re quarreling, just like two boys!
Oh, they must be tame bears!” decided Mrs.
Martin, for the shaggy chaps seemed to have
no interest except in each other or in what
they could find on the ground.</p>

<p>“What is it, Daddy, they’re fighting
about?” asked Janet, for now the two bears
were wrestling, standing up on their hind
legs, and each trying to throw the other.
Whatever the first bear had found had been
knocked from him by the second bear and
had fallen to the ground. Now they were
struggling to see which should have it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“It’s my snandwich that I dropped,” explained
Trouble. “I was over by there and
I dropped a snandwich (he always called
them that) and the bears are eating my
snandwich.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s right!” agreed Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>As the two bears wrestled, more in fun
than in anger it seemed, the one who had
knocked the sandwich from the one that first
found it, dealt his companion such a blow
as to send him staggering off against a tree.
Then the second bear pounced on Trouble’s
lost sandwich and soon ate it.</p>

<p>The first bear seemed to take it all good-naturedly
and went sniffing for more tidbits
that might have been tossed away or
dropped by the campers.</p>

<p>“Oh, aren’t they cute!” exclaimed Jan,
for by this time it was evident that the bears
would do no harm. They came to eat—not
to run the Curlytops off.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know whose they are,” said
Teddy.</p>

<p>“And I hope they don’t stay here all
night,” added Mrs. Martin. “I don’t want
to go to sleep, knowing a bear—no matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
how friendly he is—may poke his head in
on me at any moment.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see if I can drive them away,”
offered Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>“No, don’t do that!” begged his wife,
clutching him by the arm. “They might
turn on you and scratch you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they will,” said her husband.
“As you say, we don’t want to go to
sleep with bears roaming around loose, even
if they are tame bears.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they’ll go away themselves if we
give them enough to eat,” suggested Janet.</p>

<p>“Huh, that’s just the way to make ’em
stay around here!” declared Ted. “They’ll
stay as long as you feed ’em—like a stray
dog.”</p>

<p>It was evident that something must be
done, for the two bears, having picked up
all the scraps they could find outside the
camp, were now approaching closer. They
stood up and sniffed hungrily, moving their
snouts about in a peculiar way. Nor did
they appear to be afraid of the fire, on which
Ted piled more wood.</p>

<p>“I wish their keeper would come and take
them away,” said Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>Then, as if in answer to her wish, a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
came running out of the forest—a lumberman,
he seemed, with big boots on—and in
his hands he carried chains that rattled and
clanked. At the sound of the rattling chains
the bears turned, like boys caught in a jam
closet, and, dropping to all fours, would have
run into the woods, except that the man
shouted:</p>

<p>“No, you don’t, Jim! Come back here,
Jack, you little rascal! Come here, I say!”</p>

<p>The bears paused, and then, as the man
ran toward them and again shouted, they
turned about and walked slowly back to him.
In an instant he had snapped one end of the
chains he carried into collars they wore
about their necks.</p>

<p>“Hope my pets didn’t scare you folks,”
said the man, as he playfully pulled the little
short ears of his shaggy charges. “Jim and
Jack are as gentle as lambs, but you’ve got
to know how to treat ’em. Hope they didn’t
frighten you.”</p>

<p>“They didn’t—exactly,” said Mr. Martin.
“We were a bit surprised, at first, but the
bears seemed to be content to pick up scraps
about the place.”</p>

<p>“That’s what they love—picking up
scraps of food,” said the lumberman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>“Are they your pets?” asked Janet.</p>

<p>“Yes, little girl. I’ve had ’em ever since
they were little bits of cubs. Some one shot
the old bear and I found these two, like puppies,
whimpering on their dead mother. I
brought them to my camp, raised them on a
bottle until they were old enough to eat, and
I’ve kept ’em ever since. This evening they
got away, as they often do, and wandered
off, so I had to take after ’em.”</p>

<p>“Are you camping around here?” asked
Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>“Yes, in a way,” was the answer. “I’m
not camping for fun, as you folks are. It’s
business with me. I’m manager of a lumber
camp over in the woods.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yours is the camp we have been looking
for!” exclaimed Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“You’ve been looking for me?” echoed
the man, who gave his name as Pat Teeter.</p>

<p>“We met some lumbermen on a raft going
down the river,” explained Mr. Martin, telling
about the dog who bit the auto tire.
“They said you might let us inspect your
camp.”</p>

<p>“Sure, I will. We’ll be glad to have you
visit us!” declared Mr. Teeter. “There
aren’t many men in camp now, and they’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
be glad of company. We’re over in the
woods about three miles from here.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that’s rather too far to go
to-night,” objected Mrs. Martin. “And we
have things all ready here.”</p>

<p>“Then come over the first thing in the
morning,” urged Mr. Teeter. “I’ll go back
now, with my runaway bears. We’ll expect
you in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Will your bears do tricks?” asked Ted,
as the shaggy creatures on the ends of the
chains prepared to follow their keeper.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I’ll show you to-morrow,” was
the answer. “Come over to breakfast, if
you like.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, but I think it will be best to
come over directly after breakfast,” answered
Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>Mr. Teeter disappeared in the woods with
his two tame bears, and the Curlytops were
quite delighted, talking of the fun they
would have in the lumber camp the next day.</p>

<p>“I only hope those bears don’t get loose
again in the night and poke their noses in
our tent as Ted’s cow did,” said Mrs. Martin,
as they made ready for bed.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they will,” said her husband.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
“Mr. Teeter will be sure to chain
them up well.”</p>

<p>“If a bear comes I would like to ride on
his back!” stated Trouble. “Once I did ride
on a nellifunt’s back. But I would like a
bear ride, too.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe you’ll get it!” laughed
Janet, as she cuddled him in her arms.</p>

<p>In spite of what her husband had said
about the bears being well secured, Mrs.
Martin, several times in the night, awakened,
thinking she heard the shaggy cubs shuffling
along through the forest.</p>

<p>But nothing like this occurred, and morning
came without anything having happened
in the night. Breakfast was served and
eaten, the things straightened up and put
back in place, and off to the lumber camp
started the Curlytops.</p>

<p>“There it is!” cried Ted, a little later, as
they drove along the river road. He pointed
to a cluster of log cabins in the woods, cabins
set down in the midst of a clearing.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess this is the lumber camp all
right,” assented his father.</p>

<p>“I see the two bears!” added Janet, pointing
to the cubs, chained at the rear of one of
the log cabins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“Well, this will give us a new set of adventures—stopping
in a lumber camp,” said
Mr. Martin, as he guided the car over the
not very smooth road that led up to the cluster
of cabins.</p>

<p>At that moment, from down the road in
the other direction, came some strange yells,
shouts and cries:</p>

<p>“Yip! Yip! Yippie!” was yelled, and
then followed more strange noises.</p>

<p>“What do you imagine that can be?”
asked Mrs. Martin, wonderingly, of her husband,
while several dogs in the lumber camp
began to bark excitedly.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>A SMASH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Martin</span> for a time thought there must
be some sort of fight or other kind of trouble
among the lumbermen to cause all this noise.
The lumbermen, he knew, were, some of
them, rough characters, and he did not wish
the Curlytops and Trouble to see any fighting
or quarreling among them.</p>

<p>The children, however, were excited and
curious. They looked toward the bend in
the road whence the noise came, and a moment
later Janet cried out in delight:</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s the movie actors! See, there’s
Mr. Weldon!”</p>

<p>“That’s right—the cowboys!” added her
brother. “I wonder what they are doing
here!”</p>

<p>“They probably came to take some pictures
in the lumber camp,” said Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>But taking pictures seemed very far from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
the thoughts of the movie actors—at least,
for the time being. They were intent on
having a good time, for they were laughing
among themselves and many of the men were
giving voice to that “yi-yippy” yell which
sounded so wild.</p>

<p>“I guess they’ve just finished some hard
work,” said Mrs. Martin, as she laughed at
some of the antics of the riders. “They’re
like boys out of school.”</p>

<p>So it proved, for when Ned Weldon and
some others of the men who had been
friendly with the Martin family while at
Dawson’s Farm, saw the family, they rode
up and renewed their friendship, and also
told why they had come here.</p>

<p>“We had to have a lumber camp location
for this part of the film,” explained Mr.
Birch, the director. “So we came here.”</p>

<p>“But we didn’t expect to find you here,”
added Mr. Weldon, as he made his horse
prance on its hind legs, much to the amusement
of Trouble.</p>

<p>“We didn’t expect to come here,” stated
Mr. Martin. “But when Mr. Teeter invited
us we thought it would give the children
something new to see for their vacation
tour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“And they’s bears, too!” exclaimed
Trouble.</p>

<p>“I guess you mean elephants, don’t you?”
asked Mr. Weldon, who had more than once
laughed at the little fellow’s pronunciation
of the name.</p>

<p>“No, not nellifunts—bears,” insisted
Trouble. “They’s over there,” and he
pointed to the two tame bruins, chained to
a tree. The movie actors had not yet seen
the bears, it appeared.</p>

<p>But Mr. Birch had no sooner looked toward
the cubs than he gave a cry of delight
and said:</p>

<p>“Just what we want! You remember that
scene, Weldon, where you go into the old
cabin?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember that,” answered the
cowboy actor.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve been trying to think of something
funny that could happen there. The
bears will be the very thing! We’ll put them
in the cabin, and you go in. Then the bears
chase you out. It will be very funny.”</p>

<p>“Funny for the bears, maybe, but not for
me!” exclaimed Mr. Weldon. “Do you
think I’m going into a cabin with a couple
of bears?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>“Why, sure you are,” replied the director.</p>

<p>“Well, sure I am not!” cried the cowboy.
“I won’t do such a thing! Do you think I
want to be clawed by a bear and have my
clothes torn?” and he made such a funny
face that the Curlytops laughed.</p>

<p>But Trouble solved the problem by saying:</p>

<p>“They is tame bears. They won’t hurt
you, Mr. Weldon, and they eats peanuts like
nellifunts.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if they’re tame bears, that’s another
thing,” said the movie actor. “But I want
to be sure they are tame.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are,” said Mr. Martin. “The
bears came to our camp last night. We
thought they were wild, but they soon proved
to be tame. Mr. Teeter has raised them
from little cubs.”</p>

<p>“Just the thing for us, then,” said Mr.
Birch. “We’ll have those bears filmed to-morrow.
It will make a funny scene, Weldon,
with you climbing out of a cabin window
chased by bears.”</p>

<p>“All right—I’ll go through with it,” said
the cowboy with a sigh and another funny
face which made the Curlytops laugh. “But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
if they tear my clothes you’ll have to buy me
a new suit.”</p>

<p>“I will,” promised the movie director.</p>

<p>By this time the moving picture actors
and actresses had quieted down and were
getting ready to take their parts in the film.
They were to remain in the lumber camp
several days, and the Curlytops were glad of
this, for they liked to see the work being
done.</p>

<p>Mr. Birch hurried off to arrange with the
tamer of the bears about using the animals
in a scene with Mr. Weldon. The latter remained
to talk to the Martins.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Portnay here?” asked Mr. Martin.
“I don’t see anything of him.”</p>

<p>“No, he doesn’t take any part in this section
of the film,” answered the cowboy.
“But we expect him to join us in a few
days. Did you get back your box of albums
that his man took by mistake?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I have the box here in the car,”
answered the father of the Curlytops. “We
expect to reach Bentville soon, and then I
will turn the old books and pictures over to
Mr. Cardwell. I shall be glad to get rid of
them, for I am always afraid something is
going to happen to them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>One of the lumbermen came along then to
say that Mr. Martin and his family could
occupy one of the cabins in the woods while
they were in the camp.</p>

<p>“It’s only a rough shack,” he said; “but
it’s the best we have.”</p>

<p>“This will do very nicely,” said Mrs.
Martin, when they had driven over to it.
“Cows can’t poke their horns in, at any
rate.”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am, we haven’t any cows here,”
said the lumberman, with such a puzzled
look on his face that Mrs. Martin laughed
and explained about the cow that tried to
enter the tent while Ted was asleep.</p>

<p>The movie folk were distributed around
the camp in the different cabins, and soon
the place quieted down. This, as I have said,
was not the busy season at the lumber camp
in the woods, and only a few of the men were
there. Because of this, many of the cabins
were vacant, which gave the movie people
and the Curlytops plenty of room.</p>

<p>The remainder of the day Ted and his
sister, taking Trouble with them, watched
the movie actors at work. Many short
scenes were filmed, but the children were
more interested in watching Mr. Weldon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
practice, or go through, his part with the
tame bears.</p>

<p>At first the actor was a bit timid when
with the shaggy creatures. But after he had
seen Ted and Janet feed them lumps of
sugar, Mr. Weldon got courage enough to
let them eat from his hand. After that it
was easy, and he and the two cubs were soon
on friendly terms.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll try how it goes when they
chase you out of the cabin,” suggested the
director.</p>

<p>“But they’re so friendly they won’t chase
me,” said Mr. Weldon.</p>

<p>“If you have some bread and molasses
with you they will,” said Mr. Teeter.
“They’ll go anywhere to get bread and molasses.
Just have some of that with you
when you play your part. Hold it out to the
bears and then pull it away. They’ll chase
you from here to the end of Crystal Lake to
get the sweet stuff.”</p>

<p>So that was tried. One of the cabins in
the open part of the woods was picked out
as the scene in the picture.</p>

<p>The bears were put inside, and then Mr.
Weldon got ready to go through his part.
In his pocket he had some slices of bread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
covered with molasses, which the lumber
camp cook had given him. The bread was
wrapped in waxed paper so it would not
make the actor’s pocket sticky.</p>

<p>The idea in this part of the film story was
that Mr. Weldon was to enter the cabin,
thinking it held a man whom he wanted to
catch. So he approached the place on tiptoe.
But no sooner had he entered, than the bears,
who had been anxious to come out, rushed
at him. They smelled the bread and molasses
in Mr. Weldon’s pocket. There was
no need to hold it out to them.</p>

<p>“Now run!” cried Mr. Birch, while the
cameras clicked.</p>

<p>There was no need to tell Mr. Weldon to
do this. He took one look at the bears, hungry
for bread and molasses, and away he
rushed. After him lumbered the cubs—not
angry, just keen to get the sweets.</p>

<p>“That’s good! Fine! Couldn’t be better!”
cried Mr. Birch.</p>

<p>Finally the bears chased Mr. Weldon so
closely that, tame as they were, he feared
they might claw him in their eagerness. So
he climbed a tree and dropped the bread and
molasses down to the shaggy fellows.</p>

<p>This was all they wanted, and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
stopped to lick up the molasses, thus ending
the scene.</p>

<p>“That was great!” cried the director.</p>

<p>“Glad of it,” said Mr. Weldon, as he came
down from the tree after the bears had been
led away. “If it had been spoiled I wouldn’t
have done it over again. It was too exciting.”</p>

<p>But there was no need to take the bear
scene over again, as sometimes happens
when movies are being filmed. It was all
right from the first click of the cameras.</p>

<p>Other scenes were taken the next day in
the lumber camp, and in some the Curlytops
had small parts, much to their delight. They
liked it in the woods, and Mrs. Martin was
glad to remain a few days in one spot and
have the shelter of a cabin in which to sleep.</p>

<p>Mr. Birch decided that as long as he was
in a lumber camp he had better take some
scenes of chopping down trees, and this was
arranged for. Then, as his company was
one producing comedies, he wanted something
funny and decided to have a man up
in a tree that was being chopped down.</p>

<p>One of the lumbermen volunteered to take
this part, as he said it had really happened
to him once. He jumped out of the falling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
tree into another standing near by, and so
was not hurt.</p>

<p>“I can do the same thing again,” he said.</p>

<p>This scene took place on the edge of the
clearing in the lumber camp, where the light
was good. As the company carried no powerful
electric lights with them, they had to
depend on the sun, and in the depths of the
woods there was not light enough for taking
good pictures.</p>

<p>After some funny antics, the lumberman
climbed the tree. Then another man began
to chop it down. It did not take long, for
the lumbermen know how to fell a tree in a
few minutes. And as the big pine began to
sway toward the earth, the trunk being
almost cut through, Mr. Birch cried:</p>

<p>“Jump now!”</p>

<p>The man jumped, a camera filming him as
he leaped from the falling tree to one standing
near it. Then down to the earth crashed
the tall pine.</p>

<p>There was a shout of dismay from some
of the movie people standing off to one side.</p>

<p>“I hope no one was hurt,” said Mrs.
Martin.</p>

<p>Mr. Teeter came running up through the
cloud of dust caused by the fall of the tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“There’s been a smash,” he said.</p>

<p>“A smash?” repeated Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>“Yes. That tree didn’t fall just the way
it should, and it smashed down on your
auto.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is our car smashed?” cried Ted.</p>

<p>“Not all of it, but one wheel is,” said a
lumberman. “I’m afraid you Curlytops
can’t continue your tour. I’m very sorry.”</p>

<small>ABOARD THE MOTOR BOAT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> could, have been more of a disappointment
to the Curlytops just then than
to hear they could not keep on touring
around. They were having such fun they
did not want it to stop. But if they had no
auto to go in, they would have to return
home—and the trip wasn’t half finished!</p>

<p>“And how are we going to take those
albums to Mr. Cardwell?” said Teddy.</p>

<p>“Let’s go and see how badly the car is
damaged,” suggested Mr. Martin. “Perhaps
it can be repaired so we can go on.”</p>

<p>“It will need a new wheel,” answered the
lumberman. “I think one can be sent on
from the factory, or the nearest supply
house, but it will take several days. It’s too
bad!”</p>

<p>“It couldn’t have been helped, I suppose,”
said Mr. Martin, as, with his wife and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
children, he walked toward his car. “I
shouldn’t have left it there.”</p>

<p>“The tree was taller than any of us
thought,” said the lumberman. “The end
of it stuck out farther than we calculated,
and it was just the tip of it that hit your
front wheel.”</p>

<p>It did not take more than a glance from
Mr. Martin to tell him that he could not continue
touring in his auto—at least, until a
new wheel was secured.</p>

<p>“If only the tire or the rim had been
broken, we could have managed,” he said.
“For we carry a spare tire and rim. But I
haven’t an extra wheel.”</p>

<p>“We’ll get you one,” offered Mr. Birch.
“It was the fault of our company that your
wheel was broken, and we’ll pay for a new
one. I’ll telegraph and have one sent on
from Blissville at once. There is a branch
agency there that keeps parts for your car.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about it,” said Mr. Martin.
“It can’t be helped now. I am glad no one
was hurt. There is no great hurry about our
tour—a few days’ wait will not matter.”</p>

<p>But it would take more than a few days
to supply a new wheel for the one broken
on the auto, it was found out. The agency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
was out of wheels for the kind of car Mr.
Martin owned, and it would be necessary to
send to Michigan for one. This would take
about two weeks, stated the telegram that
came in reply to the one Mr. Birch had sent.</p>

<p>“Do you think we want to stay in this
lumber camp two weeks more?” asked Mrs.
Martin of her husband.</p>

<p>“Hardly,” he answered. “And yet I
don’t see how we can continue our tour without
a car.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we go on horseback?” asked
Ted. “When we were at Uncle Frank’s
ranch we rode on ponies.”</p>

<p>“I’d like a pony,” Janet said.</p>

<p>“The ponies might be all right for you
two Curlytops and for me,” said their
father. “But I hardly think your mother
and Trouble could manage it. No, we had
best either go back home or wait here for a
new wheel.”</p>

<p>Mr. Birch was saying how sorry he was
that the plans of the family had thus been
spoiled when Mr. Teeter suddenly asked:</p>

<p>“How about a motor boat?”</p>

<p>“A motor boat?” asked Mr. Martin.
“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean,” explained the lumberman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
“how would you like to keep on touring in
a motor craft? I suppose cruising would
be a better word than touring, when you
speak of a boat. But how about it?”</p>

<p>“A boat would be dandy fun!” exclaimed
Ted.</p>

<p>“I think so, too,” added his sister.</p>

<p>“But it would take us as long to arrange
to hire a boat as it would to wait for a new
wheel,” objected Mr. Martin. “Besides,
how could we get to Bentville by boat?”</p>

<p>“Very easily,” answered Mr. Teeter.
“Rockaway River, which is the stream we
float our logs down, flows from Crystal
Lake, about fifty miles up country. You
could cruise along the river, and so get to
the lake. Then you cross the lake and you’re
right at Bentville.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose we could do that,” admitted
Mr. Martin, after thinking it over.
“But what about a boat? Where could we
get one?”</p>

<p>“Take mine,” offered the lumberman.
“I have a very good little cabin motor boat
down in the river. You can put your things
from the auto into the boat and keep on
going.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Daddy, let’s do it!” cried Ted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“Please!” added Janet.</p>

<p>“I like a boat on the water,” crooned
Trouble. “Nellifunts, they squirt water
out of they trunks.”</p>

<p>“What do you say, Ruth?” asked Mr.
Martin of his wife.</p>

<p>“It sounds very nice,” she answered, with
a smile. “But I should like to see the boat.
Is there room on it for all of us?”</p>

<p>“Plenty,” said Mr. Teeter. “Come on,
I’ll show you.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t far from the lumber camp to the
Rockaway River, and at a small dock was
tied the gasoline motor boat, <i>Pine Tree</i>.
This was a very good name, the Curlytops
thought, for a boat owned by a lumberman.</p>

<p>“Say, she’s a dandy!” exclaimed Ted, as
he went on board.</p>

<p>“I like this better than an auto,” said
Janet. “There’s more room to move about.”</p>

<p>This was true. Though the <i>Pine Tree</i>
was not an especially large motor boat,
there was much more room on her than in
even the largest touring car. There was a
cabin in which they could eat, and at night
the table folded up out of the way and bunks,
like those in sleeping cars, could be let down.
A sliding partition made the large cabin into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
two small ones. One could be used by Ted
and his father, while the other would do for
Mrs. Martin, Janet and William.</p>

<p>“Well, do you think you want to go cruising
for a while instead of autoing?” asked
the lumberman.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, thank you,” said Mrs.
Martin. “I’m almost glad, now, that the
wheel was broken. This is a lovely little
boat.”</p>

<p>So it was arranged. The baggage from
the Martin car was put aboard the <i>Pine
Tree</i>, and the lockers and pantry were
stocked with food. Things could be cooked
on a gasoline stove in the little galley, or
kitchen.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget the albums,” said Mrs.
Martin to her husband, when the boat was
being made ready. “We don’t want to leave
them behind.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” he answered. “I have them
here.”</p>

<p>He stowed away, on board the <i>Pine Tree</i>,
the box of old albums which had been intrusted
to him. They were still wrapped up
as they had come by express from Mr. Portnay
in New York. The movie actor, it was
said by Mr. Birch, had been ill and would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
not resume work for a time. Then he expected
to go West to complete the film, part
of which the Curlytops had seen made.</p>

<p>“All aboard!” called Mr. Martin, on the
morning when a fresh start was to be made
in the touring plans of the Curlytops. “All
aboard!”</p>

<p>The lumbermen and the movie people had
said good-by, wishing the Curlytops and
their family all sorts of good luck. Mr.
Teeter arranged for the Martins to come
back in the boat and leave it at the camp
when they had cruised as much as they
wished.</p>

<p>“By that time I’ll have a new wheel on
your auto,” he told Mr. Martin, “and you
can drive home in the car.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” said the father of
the Curlytops.</p>

<p>You can imagine how delighted Ted,
Janet and Trouble were as they sat on the
little deck of the <i>Pine Tree</i> and looked at
the scenery along the Rockaway River, up
which they were puffing their way to reach
Crystal Lake. Mr. Martin knew how to run
and steer a motor boat. In quiet stretches
of the river he allowed Ted and Janet to hold
the wheel for a time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>“It’s just lovely here,” said Mrs. Martin
with a happy sigh as she leaned back against
a cushion. “It’s much nicer than the auto.”</p>

<p>Mr. Martin thought so, too, and while
of course he did not like to have wheels
smashed, still some good came out of it. Up
the winding river went the <i>Pine Tree</i>, new
scenes presenting themselves every minute.</p>

<p>They did not have to go ashore to spend
the night, nor even stop for meals, which
were cooked on board. Mrs. Martin took
charge in the galley, and Ted and Janet gave
whoops of delight when she blew a whistle
which meant that the first lunch was ready.</p>

<p>They did not speed along, for, as before,
Mr. Martin was in no hurry, but they took
their time, and that afternoon, as they were
passing a large town, they tied up at a wharf
and went ashore, as Mrs. Martin wanted to
buy some food which they had not been able
to put on board at the lumber camp.</p>

<p>“We aren’t going to travel in the night,
are we?” asked Ted of his father, as they
puffed along late that afternoon, the cupboard
having been well stocked at the last
stopping place.</p>

<p>“No, I hardly think so,” he answered.
“I don’t know this river well enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
navigate it after dark. When it gets a little
later we’ll anchor for the night, and go on
in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Are we going to sleep on this boat?”
Trouble wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered Ted. “Do you
think you’re going to sleep in the water?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any beds,” remarked the little
fellow, looking about.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t wonder at that,” laughed
his mother. “The beds are folded up, my
dear. They come down like this.”</p>

<p>As I have told you, the berths in the <i>Pine
Tree</i> were made to fold up during the day
like those in a sleeping car. A turn of a
handle and a pull brought down the beds out
of recesses in the cabin walls. There were
blankets, sheets and pillows stored in each
berth, just as on a sleeper.</p>

<p>“Oh, I like these little beds!” cried Trouble,
as he saw them come down.</p>

<p>“It’s a dandy boat,” declared Ted.</p>

<p>When it was dark Mr. Martin ran the boat
near shore and dropped the anchor. Then,
after a while, they all “turned in,” as a
sailor would say—that is, they went to bed.</p>

<p>Janet suddenly awakened in the night—how
late it was she didn’t know—but something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
disturbed her. A low light, operated
by a storage battery, gleamed in the tiny
cabin, and Janet looked across to the bunk
where her mother was sleeping, with Trouble
on the berth below her.</p>

<p>“Mother! Mother!” called Jan, in a low
voice, so as not to awaken her small brother.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, what is it?” asked Mrs. Martin.
She was a light sleeper, accustomed to
being awakened many times in the night by
her children.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Janet in a whisper, “somebody
is running away with the <i>Pine Tree</i>.”</p>

<p>“Running away with the <i>Pine Tree</i>! Do
you mean with this boat?” asked Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mother! We’re moving! Don’t
you feel it?”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>ON THE LAKE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Martin</span> sat up in her berth and
listened. She could hear no sound except
the gentle lapping of the water against the
sides of the <i>Pine Tree</i>. There had been no
motion when she went to sleep, for the river
did not flow swiftly at this point. But something
had awakened Janet.</p>

<p>“Don’t you feel it, Mother?” asked the
little Curlytop girl. “Don’t you feel us
moving?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I certainly do,” Mrs. Martin said,
after sitting still for a few seconds. “We are
certainly moving. I’ll call your father.”</p>

<p>“Do you think anything is going to happen?”
asked Janet, greatly excited by this
time.</p>

<p>“No, I think we are dragging our anchor—that’s
all,” answered her mother. “It
must be seen to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>Putting on her dressing gown and slippers,
Mrs. Martin went to the other cabin
where her husband was sleeping with Ted.
A touch on his shoulder awakened Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked sleepily. “Have
we reached Pittsburgh yet, porter?”</p>

<p>“You aren’t in a sleeping car, traveling
to Pittsburgh,” laughed his wife. In his
earlier days Mr. Martin had been a traveling
salesman and covered many thousands of
miles in sleeping cars.</p>

<p>“What is it, then?” he asked, sitting up.
By the gleam of the little light he saw his
wife standing near his berth.</p>

<p>“The boat is moving,” she told him.</p>

<p>“Moving?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Don’t you feel it? Janet felt it
first and called me. I think we are dragging
our anchor.”</p>

<p>“So we are!” exclaimed Mr. Martin, as
he felt the sensation of the boat moving.
“But it isn’t anything serious. I’ll drop it
in a new place where it will hold better.”</p>

<p>As he was putting on a coat and trousers
to go out on the little forward deck, where
the anchor rope was caught around a cleat,
Ted awakened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“What’s the matter?” he wanted to know.
“I’ll go up and help you, Daddy,” he offered,
when told of the trouble.</p>

<p>“All right—come along,” agreed his
father. “You had better go back to bed,”
Mr. Martin suggested to his wife.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll stay with Trouble and Janet,”
she agreed.</p>

<p>It was dark up on deck, for the <i>Pine Tree</i>
was anchored in the river away from any
town or city. The stars alone dispelled the
blackness of the night.</p>

<p>But Mr. Martin had a powerful flashlight
with him, and, switching this on, he held it
over the side, focusing the electric rays on
the water. Then he noticed something that
made him exclaim in wonder.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“Why, we’re going upstream instead of
down,” was the answer. “If we were dragging
our anchor we would float down the
river with the current. We wouldn’t go up
as we do when the motor is running.”</p>

<p>“The motor isn’t running now,” said Ted,
and it was not—the engine having been shut
off when they anchored for the night. “But
what makes us move, Daddy?”</p>

<p>“Something has hold of our anchor rope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
and is pulling us upstream by it,” said Mr.
Martin.</p>

<p>“You mean an alligator?” asked Ted.
“Oh, I wish it was daylight! I’d like to see
an alligator!”</p>

<p>“No, not an alligator,” said Mr. Martin,
with a smile. “There are none of those
creatures in these waters. But something
is towing us all right.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s river pirates,” suggested the
Curlytop boy. “You know Mr. Teeter said
river pirates once took this boat.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t pirates,” declared Mr. Martin.
“They would have to use a boat to tow us
away and there isn’t a boat in sight. No,
something has hold of our anchor rope beneath
the water. See?”</p>

<p>He held the flashlight on the hemp cable.
Ted could see where it went down into the
water, and just ahead of it were little ripples
such as are caused when a stick or a
rope is dragged through the water.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose it is, Daddy?”
asked the lad.</p>

<p>“Some sort of fish, or other water creature,
has got caught in our anchor,” decided
Mr. Martin. “It’s towing us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>“Maybe it’s a big turtle,” said Teddy.
“A big mud or snapping turtle.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” agreed his father. “I’m going
to see. Here, Ted, you hold the flashlight
and I’ll haul up on the anchor rope.”</p>

<p>The Curlytop boy focused the rays of the
powerful little electric torch on the rope extending
into the water and Mr. Martin,
taking hold of the cable, near the deck cleat
around which it was wound, began to pull
up. It was hard work, but finally he managed
to get some slack, and then Ted cried:</p>

<p>“Oh, I see! It’s a big turtle!”</p>

<p>“Yes, so it is,” agreed his father. For
he had pulled up enough of the anchor and
rope to show a great snapping turtle with
one of his flippers caught on the rope, just
where it was fastened to the “mud hook,”
as sailors sometimes call an anchor.</p>

<p>“Can you pull him on board, Daddy?”
asked Teddy.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I want to,” was his
father’s answer. “He looks like a pretty
ugly customer.”</p>

<p>A moment later the turtle gave a wriggle
and dropped off into the water with a splash.
Pulling him up had loosened his hold on the
anchor rope. Then Mr. Martin let go the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
rope, the anchor dropped back to the bottom
of the river and held in the mud, bringing
the boat to a stop.</p>

<p>“Now I guess we’re all right,” said Mr.
Martin, as he went down with Ted, who
looked to see the turtle rise again, but it did
not.</p>

<p>“What was it?” Mrs. Martin wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“A big snapping turtle, crawling along on
the bottom of the river, got caught in our
anchor and rope,” explained her husband.
“He kept right on crawling, pulled up our
anchor from the mud, and swam away.</p>

<p>“He was so powerful that he was able to
tow our boat,” went on Mr. Martin. “It
wasn’t hard to do, once he got it started, and
being on the bottom he could get a good hold
for his feet, which have claws on them.
When I pulled up the rope I loosened his
hold.”</p>

<p>“If we could keep that turtle, and train
him, he would pull the boat for us, and we
wouldn’t have to use gasoline,” said Teddy.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’d be several years getting
where we want to go,” laughed his father.
“A turtle is pretty slow.”</p>

<p>They went back to bed and were not disturbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
again that night. In the morning the
Curlytops looked for a sign of the turtle,
and even tossed bits of meat into the river,
hoping to tempt him to rise, but he did not,
probably being asleep in the mud.</p>

<p>They traveled on all that day, having a
good time aboard the <i>Pine Tree</i> and late that
afternoon they reached the place where the
river flowed out of Crystal Lake.</p>

<p>“To-morrow we’ll cruise across the lake
and reach Bentville,” said Mr. Martin.
“Then I’ll deliver the albums and after we
spend some time here, motoring about, we’ll
cruise back to the lumber camp and get our
auto, which ought to have a new wheel on
by then.”</p>

<p>“This is a big lake,” said Mrs. Martin,
looking across it as evening settled down.
“I hope no storms come when we are in the
middle.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>THE WRONG BOX</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Martin</span> decided to anchor the <i>Pine
Tree</i> for the night, rather than to try to
cruise across the large body of water in the
darkness. He had never been on the lake
before, though he had directions for reaching
Bentville.</p>

<p>“But this is a good place to stay,” he told
his wife, when they had reached the point
where the river flowed out of the lake.
“We’ll camp here.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean go ashore and camp?”
asked Teddy.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; we’ll stay on the boat,” his father
answered. “It will be better, I think.”</p>

<p>“Maybe a big turtle will give us a ride
again,” suggested Trouble. He had been
told how the queer creature of the mud had
towed the motor boat, and his great regret
was that he had not been awakened to see it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>“No, I hardly think a thing like that will
happen the second time,” said Mr. Martin,
with a laugh. “It was only by accident that
the turtle got tangled in our anchor rope.”</p>

<p>Then they made ready to spend the night
on board the <i>Pine Tree</i>. The anchor was let
down but a short distance from shore, the
boat being close to the bank so they could all
reach dry land by crossing a small gangplank
which Mr. Martin ran out.</p>

<p>When the boat had been made fast, the
Curlytops and Trouble went ashore, leaving
their mother and father to get supper, for
Mr. Martin was helping his wife.</p>

<p>“Don’t go too far, children,” called Mrs.
Martin to the three who were wandering
along the shore of Crystal Lake.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon be back,” promised Janet.</p>

<p>“I’m going to see if I can find any apples,”
said Teddy.</p>

<p>“You’ll hardly find any apple orchards
around here,” said his father.</p>

<p>But the Curlytop boy did. He was walking
along ahead of his sister and small
brother when he suddenly saw a group of
trees in a green field, and a second look told
Ted they were apple trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>“Come on,” he cried. “Let’s see if any
of the apples are ripe.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we’d better not,” said Janet.
“Whoever owns these apples wouldn’t like
us to take any.”</p>

<p>“Nobody owns ’em,” said her brother.
“There’s no house around here. I guess
they’re just wild apples and anybody that
wants can pick ’em.”</p>

<p>Ted had rather queer ideas, but he meant
no wrong, and soon the three children were
under the trees, gathering the fruit. It was
just getting ripe.</p>

<p>Presently Trouble, who seemed to care
more about running around than he did
about picking up apples, gave a cry and
pointed at something in a distant field.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Janet.</p>

<p>“It’s a man. He’s coming here,” announced
the little fellow. “I see a tramp
man.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ted!” gasped Janet, “what’ll we
do?”</p>

<p>“Well, if it’s a tramp we’ll just go back
to our boat,” decided the Curlytop lad. “He
won’t dare say a word when he sees father
and mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>“Yes, but s’posin’ it’s the man that owns
these apples?” went on Jan.</p>

<p>“Well,” and Teddy thought about that a
moment, “we can say daddy will pay him for
’em, and he will. We only took some because
we didn’t think anybody wanted ’em.
I’m not afraid.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the man, Trouble? Show me,”
Jan told her small brother. “I don’t see
any one.”</p>

<p>“There he is,” and Trouble led Janet to
a corner of the fence. It was from here that
he had looked before, coming back to tell the
news.</p>

<p>“He’s taking his time getting here,”
thought Teddy, munching an apple and following
his sister and brother. Ted decided
that if there was to be a fuss about the apples
he might as well have one to eat, anyhow.</p>

<p>“There’s the man,” Trouble said, pointing
the individual in question out to his sister
and brother.</p>

<p>Jan noted the ragged flapping coat and the
ragged hat set on one side of the head. Then
Ted saw it and gave a howl of laughter.</p>

<p>“Don’t make fun of him!” his sister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
begged. “The farmer won’t like it, and
he’ll scold us for taking his apples.”</p>

<p>“Farmer!” chuckled Ted. “That isn’t a
farmer.”</p>

<p>“Well, tramp then,” went on Janet. “He
does look like a tramp.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a tramp, either,” laughed Ted.</p>

<p>“What is it then?” Janet wanted to know.</p>

<p>“It’s a scarecrow. That must be a field of
corn, or something, over there, and the
farmer that owns it has put up a stuffed man
to keep the crows away. Ho! Ho! It’s a
scarecrow!”</p>

<p>“How can you tell?” asked Janet.</p>

<p>“’Cause it hasn’t moved since we’ve been
looking at it. Here, I’ll show you!”</p>

<p>Ted caught up a stone and threw it at the
ragged figure, the rock striking it full in the
back. There was a sound as when a stone
hits a board fence, and the ragged figure
never moved.</p>

<p>“See! I told you!” cried Ted.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess it is a scarecrow,” admitted
Janet. “I’m glad of it. Now we can take
all the apples we like.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it isn’t an apple-scarer,” laughed
Teddy.</p>

<p>“But it looks terribly natural,” said Jan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
as they turned back to the orchard. “No
wonder Trouble thought it was a man.”</p>

<p>The scarecrow was very well made, and in
the dusk of the evening would have misled
almost any one who did not know about it.</p>

<p>“My, you have enough apples for a pie
and some sauce,” said Mrs. Martin when the
children reached the boat and had told about
the ragged figure. “I don’t suppose whoever
owns the trees will mind our taking a
few apples,” she said to her husband.</p>

<p>“I think not. But to be on the safe side
and to be honest I’ll put twenty-five cents
in an envelope and hang it on one of the
branches,” said Mr. Martin, and he did this.</p>

<p>Very likely the farmer who owned the apples
was surprised on visiting his orchard
some time later to find the money and the
note with it. He had made a sale where he
had not expected to.</p>

<p>The night passed quietly, but toward
morning Mrs. Martin was awakened by the
pitching and tossing of the boat. She looked
out to find that the wind was blowing, making
the lake very rough.</p>

<p>“Do you think it will be best to start with
the wind blowing like this?” asked Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
Martin after breakfast, when the boat was
still tossing some.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” her husband answered. “I
think the breeze will go down. I am anxious
to get to Bentville and deliver the albums
to Mr. Cardwell. Then we can go about as
we please.”</p>

<p>“I think there’s going to be a bad storm,”
went on his wife.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess we’ll get to the other side
of the lake before it comes,” Mr. Martin
said.</p>

<p>But they did not. Though the wind went
down for a time just as the anchor was
pulled up and a start made, the breeze began
to rise again when they were out in the wide
water. The waves began to toss, and the
<i>Pine Tree</i>, though a staunch, stout craft, began
to pitch about.</p>

<p>“I wish we hadn’t started,” sighed Mrs.
Martin.</p>

<p>“Well, now that we have, we might as well
keep on,” her husband said. “In fact, it is
safer to go on, heading into the wind as we
are, than it would be to put back.”</p>

<p>“I like it rough,” cried Teddy, holding
fast to prevent himself being bumped about.</p>

<p>“It’s like being on a nellifunt’s back,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
declared Trouble. “It goes up and down
and jiggles.”</p>

<p>“It jiggles all right,” said his mother.
“It jiggles too much for me. What’s that,
do you suppose?” she said, as a crash
sounded in the cabin. They were all out on
deck at the time.</p>

<p>“Something fell,” replied Mr. Martin.
“Perhaps you had better go see what it is.
I can’t leave the wheel.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin went down, followed by the
children. In the cabin they saw that a pile
of valises, which had been stowed in one corner,
had toppled over. With the valises had
been placed the box sent back from New
York by Mr. Portnay.</p>

<p>In falling this box had come out of the
paper wrapping, and had opened. And
when Mrs. Martin looked at the contents she
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“The wrong box! It’s the wrong box!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean—wrong box?” called
her husband.</p>

<p>“I mean Mr. Portnay sent you back his
make-up box by mistake, and he has kept the
box of albums! Look, here are his false wigs
and paints. This is the wrong box!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>TROUBLE’S PUSSY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Martin</span>, hearing what his wife said,
gave a quick look ahead across the stormy
lake. Then, seeing no other boats in his
course, he fastened the steering wheel, so the
<i>Pine Tree</i> would keep on in a straight line,
and down into the cabin he hurried. He saw
just what the others had seen—the pile of
valises and also the wooden box with the
cover opened.</p>

<p>“It surely is the wrong box!” said the
father of the Curlytops. He noticed a collection
of wigs, false beards and mustaches,
together with a number of tubes of colored
paint such as actors use whether in the
movies or on the stage.</p>

<p>“Where are Mr. Cardwell’s albums?”
Ted asked.</p>

<p>“I suppose they are back in New York
in Mr. Portnay’s studio,” said his father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>“Unless he has discovered his mistake by
this time,” suggested Mrs. Martin, “and has
sent the right box on to us at the lumber
camp.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t know we were at the lumber
camp,” said her husband. “We only
stopped there by accident.”</p>

<p>“But Mr. Portnay knows that his company
was there, making films,” went on
Mrs. Martin. “And he might think that
they could tell where we were. I say, let’s
go back to the lumber camp and see if the
right box isn’t there.”</p>

<p>Mr. Martin thought this over a moment or
two, while the Curlytops and Trouble looked
out of small windows, or portholes, in the
cabin, noting how rough the lake was growing.
The storm was getting worse, and the
wind was howling loudly.</p>

<p>“There has been a mix-up and mistake
about this box of albums from the start,”
said Mr. Martin. “I don’t see how Mr.
Portnay could make a mistake a second time
and send us his paints and false wigs in place
of the old books.”</p>

<p>“The boxes look exactly alike,” said Mrs.
Martin. “I guess these movie people are so
busy thinking about the parts they are going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
to play that they don’t pay any attention to
much else. Or perhaps Mr. Portnay’s man
may have caused the mix-up.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a mix-up all right,” her husband
said. “And I think your advice, to go
back to the lumber camp, is the best thing
we can do. As you say, that movie man may
come there or send the box there. We’ll go
back.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to be out of this storm,” went
on Mrs. Martin. “It is getting much
worse.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed her husband, “it is. I
think I can turn back, though, with safety
if I use care.”</p>

<p>“But if we have the movie man’s things
that he puts on his face to make him look
different in pictures, how can he act?” asked
Ted.</p>

<p>“I guess he can easily get another make-up
box,” replied his father. “But it is impossible
for us to get other Cardwell albums,
and the pictures of the twins, now dead, and
the young boy lost at sea. We simply must
get back the right box. So I’ll go up and
turn the boat around. Better hold fast,
everybody, for it will be rougher going the
other way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>“I’ll come up on deck and help you steer,”
offered Ted.</p>

<p>“No, Son, you’d better stay below with
your mother, and help straighten up the
cabin,” suggested his father. “Pick up the
valises and wrap up that wrong box. Mr.
Portnay will want it back, I think.”</p>

<p>The Curlytops helped their mother set
things to rights, and then, indeed, they had
to hold on, for the <i>Pine Tree</i> pitched and
tossed in the storm, much as might her
namesake in a forest with a big wind blowing.</p>

<p>Once it almost seemed that the boat was
going to turn over, so far did she tilt to one
side. It began to rain, too, and Mr. Martin,
up on deck, had to put on his rubber coat.
But he was a good sailor, and knew how to
manage the boat.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, following a hasty meal
on cold victuals, for Mrs. Martin did not
want to light the stove in the storm, the boat
seemed to ride easier.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s going to clear off,” said
Janet.</p>

<p>But it was not that. Mr. Martin was near
shore now, and under the lee of a big hill,
which kept off some of the wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>When evening came the touring Curlytops
and their family were back where they
had started from—the place where the river
ran out of the lake.</p>

<p>“We’ll tie up here for the night, and when
morning comes we’ll navigate down the
river,” said Mr. Martin. “We’ll get to the
lumber camp more quickly than we came
away from it, for we shall be going downstream
instead of against the current.”</p>

<p>“Suppose the movie people are gone—what
then?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“Well, the men in the lumber camp will
know where they went,” answered his father.
“We’ll find them sooner or later, and
get back the right box of albums.”</p>

<p>It was still raining hard, but the wind did
not blow so fiercely in the sheltered place
where the <i>Pine Tree</i> was anchored. Jan
was glad of this, for she did not like rough
weather.</p>

<p>It was in the middle of the night, when the
storm seemed to have quieted down a bit,
that Trouble awakened his mother by calling
to her. Mrs. Martin was ever on the alert
for the calls of her children in the night, and
she had formed a habit of answering them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
when but half awake herself. Usually it was
only a drink that William wanted.</p>

<p>But this time, when Mrs. Martin became
aware that he was calling to her from his
little bunk in the sleeping cabin, she did not
hear him ask for water.</p>

<p>“Mommie! Mommie!” murmured the
little fellow.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, what is it?” asked his mother
sleepily.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you let the pussy in?” asked
Trouble.</p>

<p>“What pussy, Trouble?” she asked, not
yet quite awake. “There isn’t any pussy
here. You must be dreaming. Go to sleep
again.”</p>

<p>“Yes they is a pussy!” insisted the little
fellow, sitting up in his berth. His mother
could see him in the dim little electric light.
“They is a pussy and she’s mewing and she
wants to come in out of the rain. Bring her
in, Mommie.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin thought Trouble was imagining
all this, or that it was part of a dream.
Often he had dreams and went right on with
them when he awoke.</p>

<p>“I’ll get you a drink, and then you can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
go back to sleep again,” his mother said, as
she got up.</p>

<p>“Pussy wants a drink, too,” declared
Trouble. “She wants a drink of milk.
There! Didn’t you hear her mew?”</p>

<p>There came a lull in the storm and, to her
surprise, Mrs. Martin heard, through a porthole
opened for ventilation on the leeward
side of the boat, the mewing of a cat.</p>

<p>“Why, Trouble!” she exclaimed, “there
<i>is</i> a pussy out in the rain. The poor thing!”</p>

<p>“It’s my pussy!” declared the little fellow.
“Bring her in!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>THE RIGHT BOX</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hardly</span> stopping to think why Trouble
should claim as his the pussy that was crying
in the night, Mrs. Martin started out of the
cabin. Her husband, sleeping in the other
cabin with Ted, heard her and asked:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Trouble heard a cat crying. It’s out in
the rain. He wants me to bring it in,” his
wife answered.</p>

<p>“A cat?” questioned Mr. Martin. Then
with a little chuckle he added: “I hope it
isn’t a wildcat.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” exclaimed Ted, suddenly
awakening. “A wildcat? Have we got a
gun to shoot it?”</p>

<p>“Now don’t get excited,” laughed his
father. “This is a tame cat, I guess. I’ll
go out and get it.”</p>

<p>Slipping on his rubber coat, for it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
still raining, Mr. Martin went out on deck.
Near the porthole, which was open a little
way, but not far enough to allow the cat to
enter, was a crying, wet pussy, mewing pitifully.</p>

<p>“You poor little thing!” exclaimed Mr.
Martin, who was as fond of animals as were
his children. “We’ll take care of you. But
I wonder how you got here?”</p>

<p>The <i>Pine Tree</i> was anchored some distance
out from shore, and there was no plank
laid out on which the little cat might have
crossed.</p>

<p>“I guess she fell into the lake and drifted
down until she caught hold of our anchor
rope,” said Mr. Martin, as he brought the
drenched pussy down into the cabin. “She
climbed up on the rope and so reached the
deck.”</p>

<p>“The poor little creature,” murmured
Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“Let me have her—she’s my pussy!” demanded
Trouble.</p>

<p>He wanted her in the bunk with him, but
his mother said the wet fur of the pussy
would make the sheets damp.</p>

<p>“I’ll dry her off and give her some milk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
and then you may have her, William,” she
said.</p>

<p>The little cat, warm and almost dry, was
soon purring contentedly in William’s arms
and going to sleep with him, after lapping
up some warm milk, for Mrs. Martin, now
that the boat was not pitching and tossing,
had lighted the gasoline stove.</p>

<p>Ted and Jan looked in at the sight of the
stray pussy that had come to their little
brother out of the storm.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he cute!” murmured Jan.</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Ted, for she was looking
at her little brother and the cat—both asleep
now.</p>

<p>“They’re both cute,” whispered Jan.</p>

<p>The remainder of the night passed quietly,
and when morning came the storm had
passed and the river and lake gleamed in
the sunshine.</p>

<p>“Now for another tour,” laughed Mr.
Martin, as he and Ted hauled up the anchor.
“Back to the lumber camp!”</p>

<p>“And I hope we get the right box,” said
Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>They were going down the river the second
day, and expected to reach the lumber camp
that afternoon when, as they turned a bend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
in the stream, Ted and his father, who were
out on deck, saw a small boat just ahead of
them. There were two little boys in the boat,
and as the <i>Pine Tree</i> came into view the
boys stood up and cried:</p>

<p>“Help! Help!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” called Ted.</p>

<p>“Sit down, boys. Sit down!” ordered
Mr. Martin. “You’ll upset!”</p>

<p>The little lads sat down, but they continued
to cry for aid, and Mrs. Martin and
Jan came out to see what the trouble was.</p>

<p>“I guess they don’t know how to row, or
else they’ve lost their oars and don’t know
how to get back where they came from,”
said Mr. Martin, as he slowed the <i>Pine Tree</i>
and guided her close to the small, drifting
craft.</p>

<p>His last guess proved correct. The boys
were from a summer camp on the river.
They had set out in a boat, thinking they
could manage to row, but they knew little
of how to do it. First one oar slipped overboard
and drifted away, and then the other.
The little fellows were helpless on the river,
the current of which was carrying them
away. So they shouted for help when they
saw the <i>Pine Tree</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>“I’ll tow them back to camp,” said Mr.
Martin.</p>

<p>This he did, and received the thanks of
the parents who had begun to spread an
alarm through the camp concerning the
missing boys.</p>

<p>This turning back made the Curlytop
family a trifle late, and it was after dark
when they reached the dock in the river
alongside the lumber camp.</p>

<p>“Hello, what brings you back so soon?”
asked Mr. Teeter, as he came down with a
lantern to see who was tying up at his dock.
“I thought you’d be gone for a week
longer.”</p>

<p>“We got the wrong box,” explained Mr.
Martin. “Are the movie people still here?”</p>

<p>“No, they’ve gone,” was the answer.
“Left this morning.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” exclaimed Mrs. Martin.
“How unfortunate. Shall we ever get those
albums back?”</p>

<p>“When I say the movie people have gone,
I mean all those have gone who were here
when you were,” went on Mr. Teeter. “But
the head man is here, Harry Portnay—the
leading man I believe they call him. He’s
here with a couple of camera men. They’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
going to make some pictures of him alone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if Mr. Portnay is here, he’s the very
one I want to see,” stated Mr. Martin. “I
hope he has the right box.”</p>

<p>“He’s right over in that cabin,” said the
lumberman who owned the tame bears. “I
guess he hasn’t gone to bed yet—there’s a
light going.”</p>

<p>Mr. Martin, carrying the wrong box,
hastened over to the cabin of the movie
actor. Mr. Portnay greeted the visitor,
looked at the box the Curlytops’ father held
out, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“That’s mine!”</p>

<p>“And I guess that’s mine!” exclaimed
Mr. Martin, pointing to a box just like it on
the table. “Has that two old photograph
albums in it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it has,” answered the movie actor.
“And has the box you have there some wigs
in?”</p>

<p>“It has,” answered Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness! Now I can go on with
my picture. I really need certain wigs and
false whiskers, because I used them earlier
in the film, and it would look strange to see
me go into a room with one sort of beard on
and come out with quite another, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
might happen. I am glad to get my own box
back again.”</p>

<p>“And I am glad to get back my right box,
the one with the albums in it,” said Mr.
Martin, opening the second package and
making sure the Cardwell albums were
within.</p>

<p>Then the actor explained how, in the hurry
and bustle of getting to New York and looking
after matters there, one of his men had
packed and shipped the wrong box.</p>

<p>“I did not find it out until yesterday when
I wanted to get ready to finish making this
picture,” said Mr. Portnay.</p>

<p>“And I did not open the box you shipped
me by express, for of course I thought it was
the right one,” said Mr. Martin. “It was
a series of mistakes all around.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad it has ended now,” said
the actor.</p>

<p>The Martin family spent the next few
days in the lumber camp, watching pictures
being made of Mr. Portnay in his false hair
and beard, which completely changed his
appearance. But the making of these pictures
was not as interesting as the taking
of those with the cowboys and bears in them.</p>

<p>“Well,” announced Mr. Martin, a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
days later, when Mr. Portnay had packed
his belongings and gone to join his moving
picture company, “I think we had better resume
our tour. The new wheel has arrived
for the auto, and we’ll go on in that.”</p>

<p>“Whatever you do, be sure that you have
the old albums in the right box,” cautioned
Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>“I’ll not let them out of my sight again
until I deliver them to Mr. Cardwell,” declared
Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>About a week later, after a jolly trip and
some adventures, the touring party reached
Bentville and called on Mr. Cardwell.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see you,” said Reuben, the
brother of James Cardwell, who had sent the
albums. “I had a letter from Jim, and he
told me you were bringing these. But I was
beginning to think you were lost.”</p>

<p>“The albums nearly were—more than
once,” said Mr. Martin. “But I’m glad
you now have them.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” said the old man. “We think
a great deal of these pictures,” and he
looked lovingly at the photographs of the
twins and of the sailor boy, lost at sea.</p>

<p>So the summer tour of the Curlytops
came to a successful end. They remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
for a time in Bentville, and then started
back home, reaching there safely after some
jolly adventures.</p>

<p>“It was the best summer we ever had,”
declared Janet.</p>

<p>“Corking good times!” exclaimed Ted.</p>

<p>“But we didn’t see any nellifunts!” lamented
Trouble.</p>

<p>“Never mind, maybe we shall next year,”
said Janet, with a laugh.</p>
